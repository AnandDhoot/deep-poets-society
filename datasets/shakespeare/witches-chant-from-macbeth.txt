 Round about the couldron go:
 
 In the poisones entrails throw.
 
 Toad,that under cold stone
 
 Days and nights has thirty-one
 
 Sweated venom sleeping got,
 
 Boil thou first in the charmed pot.
 
 Double,double toil and trouble;
 
 Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
 
 
 Fillet of a fenny snake,
 
 In the cauldron boil and bake;
 
 Eye of newt and toe of frog,
 
 Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
 
 Adder's fork and blindworm's sting,
 
 Lizard's leg and howlet's wing.
 
 For charm of powerful trouble,
 
 Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
 
 Double,double toil and trouble;
 
 Fire burn and couldron bubble.
 
 
 Scale of dragon,tooth of wolf,
 
 Witch's mummy, maw and gulf
 
 Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,
 
 Root of hemlock digg'd in the dark,
 
 Liver of blaspheming Jew;
 
 Gall of goat; andslips of yew
 
 silver'd in the moon's eclipse;
 
 Nose of Turk, and Tartar's lips;
 
 Finger of birth-strangled babe
 
 Ditch-deliver'd by the drab,-
 
 Make the gruel thick and slab:
 
 Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,
 
 For ingrediants of our cauldron.
 
 Double,double toil and trouble,
 
 Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
