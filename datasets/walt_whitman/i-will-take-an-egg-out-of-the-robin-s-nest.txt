 I WILL take an egg out of the robin's nest in the orchard,
 
 I will take a branch of gooseberries from the old bush in the garden,
 
 and go and preach to the world;
 
 You shall see I will not meet a single heretic or scorner,
 
 You shall see how I stump clergymen, and confound them,
 
 You shall see me showing a scarlet tomato, and a white pebble from
 
 the beach.
