 
 THAT shadow, my likeness, that goes to and fro, seeking a livelihood,
 
 chattering, chaffering;
 
 How often I find myself standing and looking at it where it flits;
 
 How often I question and doubt whether that is really me;
 
 --But in these, and among my lovers, and caroling my songs,
 
 O I never doubt whether that is really me.
