 SO far, and so far, and on toward the end,
 
 Singing what is sung in this book, from the irresistible impulses of
 
 me;
 
 But whether I continue beyond this book, to maturity,
 
 Whether I shall dart forth the true rays, the ones that wait unfired,
 
 (Did you think the sun was shining its brightest?
 
 No--it has not yet fully risen;)
 
 Whether I shall complete what is here started,
 
 Whether I shall attain my own height, to justify these, yet
 
 unfinished,
 
 Whether I shall make THE POEM OF THE NEW WORLD, transcending all
 
 others--depends, rich persons, upon you,
 
 Depends, whoever you are now filling the current Presidentiad, upon
 
 you,                                                         10
 
 Upon you, Governor, Mayor, Congressman,
 
 And you, contemporary America.
 
 
 Whitman, Walt. 1900. Leaves of Grass.
