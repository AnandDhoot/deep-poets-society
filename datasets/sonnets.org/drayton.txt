From Idea (1594, revised 1619)
Because Idea's Mirror and, eventually, Idea were so frequently revised/reordered, I've omitted numbers from before the titles.
Read Idea in its entirety at Luminarium.
Read some comments by John Erskine.

To the Reader of These Sonnets (University of Toronto)
"Like an adventurous seafarer am I"
"How many paltry, foolish, painted things" (University of Toronto)
"As other men, so I myself do muse"
"To nothing fitter can I thee compare"
"An evil spirit, your beauty, haunts me still" (University of Toronto)
"A witless gallant, a young wench that wooed"
"Methinks I see some crooked mimic jeer"
"Our floods' queen, Thames, for ships and swans is crowned"
"Some misbelieving and profane in love"
"Dear, why should you command me to my rest"
"Some men there be which like my method well"
"Whilst thus my pen strives to eternize thee"
"Calling to mind since first my love begun" (University of Toronto)
"In pride of wit, when high desire of fame"
To the River Ancor (University of Toronto)
"Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part"
"Truce, gentle love, a parley now I crave"
