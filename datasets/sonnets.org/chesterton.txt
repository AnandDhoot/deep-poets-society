From "The Poet and the Cheese" in A Miscellany of Men (1912).

Sonnet to a Stilton Cheese







. . .There (after trifling with beef, mutton, puddings, pies, and so on) I got a Stilton cheese.  I was so much moved by my memories that I wrote a sonnet to the cheese.  Some critical friends have hinted to me that my sonnet is not strictly new; that it contains "echoes" (as they express it) of some other poem that they have read somewhere.  Here, at least, are the lines I wrote :-- 





SONNET TO A STILTON CHEESE

Stilton, thou shouldst be living at this hour
And so thou art.  Nor losest grace thereby;
England has need of thee, and so have I--
She is a Fen.  Far as the eye can scour,
League after grassy league from Lincoln tower
To Stilton in the fields, she is a Fen.
Yet this high cheese, by choice of fenland men,
Like a tall green volcano rose in power.
Plain living and long drinking are no more,
And pure religion reading "Household Words",
And sturdy manhood sitting still all day
Shrink, like this cheese that crumbles to its core;
While my digestion, like the House of Lords,
The heaviest burdens on herself doth lay.

(See Wordsworth's London, 1802)




I confess I feel myself as if some literary influence, something that has haunted me, were present in this otherwise original poem; but it is hopeless to disentangle it now.
