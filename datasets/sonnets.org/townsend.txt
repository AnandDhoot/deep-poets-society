"Ariel, my industrious servant!" (The T~empest)

Tossed from the falconer's hand, in graceful flight
Of sweeping circles, see the hawk arise
In joyful grandeur to her native skies!
Her bells quick rattling from her airy height,
While over the head of lady and of knight
She sails majestic, watchful of the prey,
With dogs and hunters and the field's array:
Noble associate! fearful the delight,
How ardent and how spiritual made
By her mysterious presence! we attend
On no dull moving earthiy power for aid,
A hovering being of the skies our friend;
So, over the isle his wand the enchanter swayed,
Proud on his faithful Ariel to depend.
