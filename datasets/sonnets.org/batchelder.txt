The old, old wonder of the lengthening days
Is with us once again; the winter's sun,
Slow sinking to the west when day is done,
Each eve a little longer with us stays,
And cheers the snowy landscape with his rays:
Nor do we notice what he has begun
Until a month or more of days have run,
When we exclaim: "How long the light delays!"

So let some kindly deed, however slight,
Be daily done by us, that to the waste
Of selfishness some light it may impart,Â—
Mayhap not noticed till we feel the night
Is less witihin our souls, and broader-spaced
Has grown the cheerful sunshine of the heart.


(Text from Representative Sonnets by American Poets)
