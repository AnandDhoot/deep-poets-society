Love's Martyrdom

Sweet--we will hold to Love for Love's sweet sake,
Seeing Love to us must be his own reward:
Haply we shall not find our task too hard,
Nor suffer from intolerable ache.
Yea, though henceforth our lives asunder break,
From every comfort-giving hope debarr'd,
Love may support his martyrs, and the scarr'd
And wounded heart may triumph at the stake.

Sweet--not for us Love's guerdons: not for us
The boons which wont Love's constancy requite;
No whisper of low voices tremulous,
Kiss, or caress; no breath of Love's delight:
Yet will we hold our joyless troth and thus
Achieve Love's victory in Fate's despite.
