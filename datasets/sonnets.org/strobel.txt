Your Sadness










Your Sadness

Not because beauty is as thin and bright 
In you as the white outline of a tree 
In winter, but because I find delight 
In the curved sadness of your lips. (I see 
Pleasanter things each day, each day recall 
Happy faces, laughter that knew a way 
To spin senses to oblivion.) . . . All 
Your words are swift upon your lips and grey 
As swallows, yet I stay to listen, yet 
I cannot tear myself away from you: 
For in a little while you may forget 
Your sadness. O no matter what I do 
You may forget your sadness -- O my dear 
And even smile, and make the mystery clear!
