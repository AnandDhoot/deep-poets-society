"A native of Westerly, R.I.  Her maiden name was 
Barber.  She has been a contributer for twenty years, and is the author of 
the lines, Build a little fence of trust, etc. In 1889, she published 
Cockle Shells and Silver Bells         
           
                
            .

    Homesickness

We oft are sorrowful yet have no word
To tell why gloom has settled on the day
Like clouds that blot the azure field with gray;
We know not why the singing of a bird
Touches the soul to pain as if we heard
Within the voice another music say
Things not translated in our human way;
We pierce ourselves with blame yet have not erred.

Exiles we are, and when the outreaching heart
 Is quickened to sense its native atmosphere,
When through the fair world's form the spirit part
  Reveals itself an instant passing dear,
When in a flower's sweet face new meanings dart
We mourn, shut out, for that which is so near.


(Text from Representative Sonnets by American Poets)
