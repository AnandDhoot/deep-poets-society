Sparta to Troy










Sparta to Troy
(With thanks to the forgotten wit who first found the thirteenth line)

Young rose that budded by Eurotas's stream 
(I've thumbed through Rand McNally, and -- I know!), 
All ages headline your shy April dream, 
And whisper, "Helen . . . Paris . . . Yes, it's so!" 
Homer retailed the rhythm of the oars 
That scarred the sea of time in that wild ride; 
Poets have peered and peeped of those old shores 
Where you -- and war -- splashed in Scamander tide. 

Your posthumous publicity fills reams 
And reams of incandescent lyrics, whirled 
Wherever man desires, or woman dreams 
Of love, with cheeks on fire, and lids half furled . . . 
How far that little scandal sheds its beams! 
So shines a naughty deed in a good world.
