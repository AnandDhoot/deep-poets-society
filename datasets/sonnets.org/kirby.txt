Montmorency










Montmorency

The Master saith, "Look in thy heart and write
What thou hast heard the voices say, within
The flashing rainbows and the mist, the din
And avalanche of waters snowy white,
Of Montmorency leaping down the height."
I feel the throbbing of the joyous linn
Keep time and measure with my pulses in
A thrilling symphony of sound and sight.
For history, poetry, and wild romance,
The old, the new, Nature's exuberance--
Peace, war, and love--love still the best of all--
Their story here on every side I learn,
And Wolfe's and Montcalm's rival camps discern
In the long thunder of the roaring fall.
