George Herbert was greatly influenced by the work of John Donne, a friend of the Herbert family. In a brief study of George Herbert, T. S. Eliot instructively compares two sonnets--Prayer by Herbert and Holy Sonnet 14 by Donne.  Eliot finds in Donne more of the "orator," a contrast to the more intimate tone of Herbert, a contrast that may reflect the size of Donne's large congregation at St. Paul's Cross versus Herbert's small rural parish in Wiltshire.
