Ultima Thule

The blue heaven spreads before me with its keen
And countless eyes of brightness,--worlds are there,--
The boldest spirit cannot spring, and dare
The peopled universe that burns between
This earth and nothing.  Thought can wing its way
Swifter than lightning-flashes, or the beam
That hastens on the pinions of the morn;
But, quicker than the glowing dart of day,
It tires and faints along the starry stream,--
A wave of suns through countless ether borne,
Though infinite, eternal! yet one power
Sits on the Almighty Center, whither tend
All worlds and beings from time's natal hour,
Till suns and all their satellites shall end.
