Two other fourteeners, "The Folly of Being Comforted" & "Never Give All the Heart," appear in the same book, both rhyming in couplets (aabbccddeeffgg). The first follows a regular iambic throb, the extra unaccented syllables being well within the convention of ellision (the way two unaccented syllables can sometimes be drawled together.) The second keeps to tetrameter. Both are imitation Ronsard (1524-85), as were many of his more popular poems to this point - "When You Are Old," "He Wishes His Beloved Were Dead," etc. Yeats could not be taking Ronsard, one of the most prolific sonneteers of the Renaissance, as worthy of imitation, without cultivating a desire to master the sonnet himself. He too has an impossible love, the tempestuous Maud Gonne. He too couches his complaints in rhetorical devices. The Beloved's name goes unspecified. In fact, all the characters go nameless. "One who is ever kind said yesterday / 'Your well-beloved's hair has threads of grey / & little shadows come about her eyes." But his heart protests. He will refuse any comfort, so long as the woman of his dreams refuses him. Yeats exposes his familiarity with the traditional role of unrequited love in the sonnet. As someone said, the poet seems to say "pity my misfortune, but admire my skill." We are meant to be aware of the artifice & the very nature anguish underneath, all at once. As Yeats ends the second poem, "He that made this knows all the cost / for he gave all his heart & lost."
