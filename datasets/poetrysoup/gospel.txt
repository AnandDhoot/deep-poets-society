MY RAVEN 2

I opened my mouth again
Where lies my brook?
Where are thou my Raven
Raven's miracle I seek
The man came back with a stern look
His white beard stood akimbo 
" Bro. Stephen, lets I forget, next time
Please don't finish all your chicken oooo
And stop shouting please... 
Your Raven miracle you've eaten
Go home... for others are still trying to connect"
 
It dawned on me painfully 
Maybe I shouldn't have beckoned to them to join me
Maybe...I would still be devouring the chicken alone
As I walk pass others on the mountain, 
Many still longing for more from the fountain
Some still snoring on church mats
Communing with other bed-bugs and rats 
One man was beckoning with his hands in his sleep
I ran towards him and held his hand
"No, don't call others" I shouted
He woke up anyways 
And dealt me a heavy slap 
"Why would you wake me up"
My other cheek got adorned with another slap
Just like a proverbial Jesus Christ 
" I was signing a contract with some white men
And you held my pen and my hand"
Again, my mouth was ajar
Expressionless... yet thoughtless
My heels took on me
Though still longing for my Raven's miracle
But no more from Elijah ... for I am Bro. Stephen
