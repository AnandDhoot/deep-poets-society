You have to love Leonard

I have an illustrious dream,
     want to be Leonard 
          Cohen's gypsy wife, 
he's kissing my lips on
    Boogie Street,
impetuously we dance
    to the end of love
       'til closing time
       midst his secret life,
he serenades me with
     I'm your man
         when we take Manhattan,
bewildered by his poetic beauty
     waiting for the miracle to happen,
a sip of wine, a cigarette 
         in love we disappear,
   here it is, you got me singing
        be that dog in heat,
I'll take this waltz and 
   another please, cause
             everybody knows
     I hunger for your touch,
  his famous blue raincoat
         and the dew on my thigh 
goes a thousand kisses deep
   in the cave at the tip of the lily
  with its very own breath of brandy,
slipping into the masterpiece
             where Lenny is eternal

If you don't love Leonard Cohen's poetry and music, it probably won't make much sense.
