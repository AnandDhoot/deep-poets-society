SONNET II: A Celebration of Life

SONNET II
A CELEBRATION OF LIFE
At your arrival, Your Royal Majesties,
Screaming siren in the procession of Cars and Guards
The Passersby is amused: is this a Burial or an Inauguration?

At your arrival oh Gs of this world,
You got the ovation of Everyone but the Dead
Youâ€™ve come Celebrating the Loss of a Soul
Your Brightest Clothes, the Most Pimped Rides.

Alas, at His arrival, The King of the Universe
The Celebrities gone, the Dead Buried to Rot.
The Peaceful Presence is here, behold the Silent Procession.
The Ever Present Presence is proclaimed
The Still Small Voice is sent out
Behold; the Bereaved Soul is Consoled.
