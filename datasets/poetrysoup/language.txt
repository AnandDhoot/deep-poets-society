The Verb as a Volt

The verb, when well wired,
acts as a unit of electrical 
potential equal to the difference
between two sparks of meaning
on a graduated scale
of question marks,
carrying a constant current
of one impact.
When poetic power
charges the space
between the thought
and the word
there is a jolt,
and a vault from an ought
to a fact
In the right hands
a marvelous toy.
