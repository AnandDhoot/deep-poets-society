FEMALE OLYMPIC GYMNASTS

Running into a fixed object
Must send senses into conflict,
Yet girls hit that horse at full spree.
Watching female gymnasts thrills me.

Parallel bars seek perfect catch,
Sailing, holding forms few can match,
Then sticking the mat easily.
Watching female gymnasts thrills me. 

Girls transfix on a four inch beam
Where flips, splits, and cartwheels are seen.
Bodies rip and zip moves freely.
Watching female gymnasts thrills me. 

Floor routines spark my excitement.
They toss, fly, leap in amazement.
I become spellbound with pure glee.
Watching female gymnasts thrills me. 

Spry bodies do things mine will not
With talent hot and grace on spot.  
Gymnasts defy known gravity.
Such sights give goose bump thrills to me!
