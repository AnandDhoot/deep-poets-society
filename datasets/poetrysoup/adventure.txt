Legends Of The Fall



Fall; somewhere up north
an Indian kept one's vaneri
an image of thy soul kept a roth
of a great legendary story
a girl so beautiful an pretty
kept all three brother's witty
an threw th' dice at war 

Up against th wall shadows crawl 
leave behind th fall an novel all 
a stroke of an old man kept th' role
to never end yet keep thou pole
of life an birth that thou art call
inspired by th' movies gracious facts
having touched th' inner glimpse
beautiful actor's tracked in act 
of playing a story by d're lips
smoke an war left a hint of a branch
of a tree of a family of a bears waul
of power an strength thou art placed
reality hence felt an threw th' race
