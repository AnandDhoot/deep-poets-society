Protesting Poets


Poets in the pot
Striving not to get cooked
For poverty in the hood
As gotten all hooked 
Becoming ingredients of hunger 
For all to maw

A new season...
A fresh session...
For the wrong reason... 
Recession a new name 
Best known to them

Stimulating ideas cocooned 
We are the laughing flock
of several rudderless shepherds
Life of a wordsmith activist
Still in the soup stewed 

Strands of words
whittled to bullets and pellet
Firing from all cylinders
our pot-belly shepherds 
Sorting out issues with Pen
But bullied with hunger

Ohhhhhhh... 
Analytical paralysis in full swing
Poetry an apt medium 
for language of protest

Bully me not today 
With words, we travel to freedom castle 
With hunger, we fro back into fiefdom cabin
Bold and grave, brave and spot on
Fighting with the tongue and pen 
Shall our tongues be mute
when deeds are wrought 
Yet our minds far away 
From the battle field
