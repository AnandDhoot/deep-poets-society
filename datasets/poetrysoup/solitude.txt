Solitude


No kindly weather this
This that strips me of all but weariness
Weariness creeps through my soul this dull day
Day of colliding colours dimmed, wasted, washed away, and I
I am drawn down into it's poverty of greyness, I drown
Drown while dark clouds weep
Weep for the solitary sparrow that flies
Flies on a cruel wind, on the cusp of Life's deadly thrust
Thrust about, poor bird, shall it be lost?
Lost, brought down, uncared for, turned to dust
Dust and no kind eyes to watch it while it dies
Dies in the claw of raw solitude

Solitude....an ache somewhwere between day and night
An ache, somewhere between day and night...
