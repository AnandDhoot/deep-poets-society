SAT TO CHAT

At the end of the elated visit
Around the mind moving marble mausoleum -Taj Mahal
I was unconvinced to leave and got a place to sit
As excited to enjoy the environment, withal

It was the inside on the right, near the main entrance 
Just before the famous ‘visitors bench’
from where visitors pose, with faces full of romance
As a monumental memory, though the fire won’t quench 

I was seated at a comfortable distance
To watch this mankind’s magnificent marble marvel
My mind churned the charm, inch by inch
With visitors from the entire globe, lining after a long travel

Of all colors, gathering was the crowd of tourist 
With dressing styles that were, to this land, new 
My emotions of excitement, I could not resist
Their expression of ecstatic too, none knew

Flocking was also the beeline of photographers 
With the face of everyone, full of excitement
Earnestly everyone was immersed, as none bothers
None can forget in life, this joyful moment

Distracted my ‘dream-like-reality’ was an eagle
He was flying low, short rounds over the main dome
Over his unusual behavior, into me, I did giggle
He returned after two short rounds, as it was awesome

He now flied directly to the Finial – Islamic moon symbol atop 
He sat over the Finial, as if he came to chat with me 
A new relationship between us began to develop
I enormously enjoyed this ecstatic and wondered to watch the game

Joy or grief never lasts for longer
As he could not sit there comfortably 
As the edges seems sharper and stronger 
My friend was forced to fly away, inevitably

This play of this eagle, perhaps I only noticed
Perhaps only towards me, He sat to chat
Taj as universal ‘symbol of love’ is highly placed  
The joy of watching the eagle too, a tantalizing treat!
