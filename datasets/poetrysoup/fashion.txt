Dream Chasing

Having a dream can be so amazing.
But if you're not going to put the work in it, then why chase it.
To follow your dreams is a stepping stone of what you are made of.
Grasping the knowledge of what you're good at then just blow it up.
Believing in your in your dreams shows character, dedication and passion.
There will be a lot of people that will not like it.
Please don't let it stop your actions.
Chasing your dreams is a whole other level.
Its like graduating from being smart to intelligent, the work is a little harder.
And the rewards are much greater.
Never let the negative attitudes of others put you in danger.
Because living your dreams you will find complete happiness and find new places.
Its all about you and those dreams you're chasing.
