Happy Birthday, Lolly

As I lie in bed to the pouring rain
And the words just stare on the page refrain.
Every year they speak - every year appease
But this year they seem just to laugh and tease.

How can words absolve all the absent time
That we've spent apart with a simple rhyme?
How did distance win? How did time grow old?
How do friendships last in the winter cold?

There was so much love and support and cheer;
In our uni days it was goon or beer.
But the strength we had and the endless fun
Still remain in our hearts, forever young.

And although we are old - we are also wise
Which, in time, will reveal a new sunrise.
So enjoy this day and this year and this you;
It's the only time you'll EVER be thirty two.
