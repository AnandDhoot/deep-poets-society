Naddred 2:

Ravens chew on twigs while deep in thought,
Larks have three dots on their tongue,
Badgers are the keepers of the sacred stories,
Blackbird is the bird of both the gateway and forge.
Cernunnos is lord of the Underworld and wild animals,
Follow the white hind into the mystical forest.
As Tuan had lived as a stag, an eagle, and salmon,
Where the Tuatha de Danaan were the faery gods,
Living on Emerald Isle as the Sidhe, (shee)
Twenty trees are the number of the secreted Ogham,
And the wrens nest is the Druid's nest.
We priests must walk in both worlds,
In the world of form, and of force.
Awen to all... /|\
