ODE TO MY LITTLE BOY

From his voice springs the tenderest sound of lute
There is not a moment
mute
In the company of my little cherubim
Oh how I love him, how I love him!
 
Dissonance played in my core.
Before his birth 
My first born.
Our pride and Joy.
The cold of winter is all but gone, gone, gone!
Even your sulkiness embalms my soul.
You and your sister bring the most
Joy joy joy!
 To our household.
 
 
 
* to my little boy
