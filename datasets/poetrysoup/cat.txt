My Dear Kitten

My Kitten

My pretty dear kitten 
So dear that I'm not bitten 

Eats with care 
She's so fair

My dear little kitten
Fine and sweet with mitten 

Hang-out and sits merely 
With me, works closely

My silly little kitten 
Laughs and counts fifteen 

She runs with me all the way
Always meow,meow and make a brighter day
