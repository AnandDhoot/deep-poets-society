How will I grow old

What will I be like when I'm frail and old,
will I lament over long departed youth and innocence,
will grand-children listen to my stories of daring and suspense,
or will they vex my patience causing me to shout and to scold.

What will it mean for me to be a senior citizen,
will tomorrows youth give me some respect,
will I still use social media hoping to connect,
maybe callow youth will place me among the wise men.

Will I marvel at what new technologies are invented,
or will I become apathetic and nonchalant,
when I'm older will I be fully contented,
perhaps I will be an old codger who children love to taunt.

Will I lose my enthusiasm for learning and fresh experience,
still hoping everyday that I matter and make a difference,
or will I abandon my current interests and worldly understanding,
too much to ruminate over when contemplating ones aging.
 
How many summers will I remember their joy and vitality,
maybe I'll become incontinent and suffer indignity,
perhaps I will be overly critical over decadence and immorality,
or become a true gentleman who exemplifies charm and geniality.

Will I continue to be stubborn and independent,
or will I swallow my pride and accept a helping hand,
will I still loudly listen to my favorite rock 'n' roll band,
even when I'm wrinkled from head to toe and bent.

Will I become less critically vocal and more mellow with age,
as each day passes by printing a new page,
will I read between the lines and gain fresh insight and wisdom,
becoming a man I want to be, full of compassion and altruism.

Will there still be romance and idealism for me with fellow old timers,
shall I wear pajamas all day long or trousers with the bottoms rolled,
I would cry the day if I was diagnosed with the dreadful Alzheimer's,
not remembering anyone that I love, cherish and lovingly hold.

I do not fear the the day when I realize I have more memory than future,
if I can retain my sense of wonder and peculiar brand of humor,
remaining active and passionate and not fall into a catatonic stupor,
enjoying all my future days with my wife, who everyday becomes cuter.
