The Zenith of my Prime

The zenith of my prime has come and gone
and here I sit and wait my setting sun
with dreams and wishes longing to come true
I won't lie down in death till they are through

I've yet to taste the glory of those lips
of love divine, I've only taken sips
the Warrior Princess, yet remains inside
a seething muse that I am forced to hide

I've yet to write the world into a rhyme
to go on after me, defying time
I've yet to travel to enchanted place
and live a thousand lives and dance with grace

I've yet to swim like mermaid in the sea
with not a single thing to cover me
I've yet to lie on sands in twilight hue
to feel the naked rush of feelings new

I've yet to sing my song and feel the praise
of hands that lift me high and lights that daze
I've yet to gaze upon what eyes adore
my gypsy heart has treasure still in store

And so, this pain that dwells in me yet screams:
"You must not die until you've lived your dreams.
Uncover dreams: bring every one to light
Oh, live and love and blaze before the night
