Diamond Cut

"A Broken Demo"

In a desperate cry for help
She hires every jeweler
A cheap sheep crying, Wolf!
Using old repeating politic
utilizing lies * manipulation 
To cover the Glass Paste on her face
     Diamond-like - Stonecold and Crooked!

Her true shape -- unveiled -- predictable 
    A Thief Among The Mines
In a world where certainties are few---
Promises! Promises! 
A shallow cut - with high class
   no shape --- no spark, a dark mass
Smashing success when opportunity hits
The worst gem in disguise
The diamonds in her eyes -- gone -- expired

If you look, you will see
A twisted reflection in her evil grin
A sinister smile -- waiting to win
Her Vice - a victim --- her puppet
  blind * believing her lies
Cutting the light performance -
   -Without realizing most see past her history

We the people are more than a cubic step
Lighting the madness of her soul
Just remember, every day she sits on her pedestal
Without a twinkle --- she stares into night
Knowing nothing she stands for is right
 
Innovation - incomplete 
A man-made she-demon wearing white
Like the swan, dying every night
She refuses to hear the trumpet play
A new moon soon will open our eyes
SOLD AS IS  ---  Diamond CUT
