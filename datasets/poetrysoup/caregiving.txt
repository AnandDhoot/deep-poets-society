Last Sound

I call you,
In the dark of night,
Hoping you can help me,
And make things right,
Alone,
Cold,
Bitter sweet end,
The last sound I hear,
Before I commit a sin,
It's wrong,
For one to take their own life,
Sometimes you feel,
Theres no way out,
A sharp utensil,
That slowly eases pain,
Or a one shell,
That comes from a gun,
It's never to late,
To get help where you may,
No one can force your hand,
But can help you pray,
Be that savior,
For someone in need,
Lend a helping hand,
For that may be,
All they seek....
