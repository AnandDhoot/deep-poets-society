Road Works Again.

Major road works up ahead all traffic get in lane.
Is what the sign said this morning
just past Hollins Lane.
Delays are rife throughout the day
was on this mornings news.
So plan your journey carefully
which ever way you choose.
It will not matter which road one takes
There's roads blocked up ahead
with queues and queues at traffic lights
lingering constantly on red.
I think I'll take the car back home
and go straight back to bed.
And hope tomorrow brings good news
and I won't lose my head.
