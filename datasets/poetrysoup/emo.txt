Three of You

THREE OF YOU 

I want to stay 
With you three, all the way 

Pain is with me 
Everyday  can’t  you see? 

I’m alive when you’re here by my side 
And enjoy with you every ride 

Games played are always enjoyable 
But mind sometimes trick, its undeniable

Let’s look at the side which is bright 
And direct me to that  light

You’ll no longer cry
When you look at me and try
