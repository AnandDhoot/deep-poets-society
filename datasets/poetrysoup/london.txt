A Tribute to our Soldiers



Fare thee well our precious men and boys
Marching into war
Fighting for a purpose
Does anyone know what for

As some you return lying down
Instead of tall and strong
How can we all sit and watch
Surely this is wrong

Will you buy a poppy
Will you shed a tear
13,310 soldiers
Killed in 10 years

Downing street want to resign
Saying it is now the time
That's not a victory we know its a crime
That's not a victory on the front line

The soldiers do their jobs
Fighting for our Queen
Lets not forget though the military supplies
Not the best we have seen

A lack of helicopters sent to assist
These terrorists could now be missed
British soldiers now lost their lives
Us army men also lost to their wives

We need to help somehow
Britain decide what to do
The lives of our servicemen around the world
Could depend on you

Why should we leave this to them in London Town
Mp's who don't know what biscuit they like, I frown
