Power in words

There's power in the words that you speak, words can make you strong and words can make you weak. Words can make you well and words can make you ill, words can fill you with love and words can make you want to kill.  Words can make you happy and words can make you sad, words can have you do good and also have you do bad.  Words can make you ashamed or have you feeling proud,  words can make you silent or have you speaking out loud.

Words can make you and also break you, words can cause you to win and also to lose.  Words can lift you up and many can tear you down, one minute you're floating on a cloud and the next you're wallowing in the ground.  Words are so easy to flow from the lips, but some words have the power to sink ships.  Think about the words you say before you speak, don't think you're so tough that you won't ever become weak.  You can't just say anything you want to people and not expect a pay back, remember what goes around comes around, and that's not fiction it's a well known fact.
