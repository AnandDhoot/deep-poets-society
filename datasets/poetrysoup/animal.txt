Basil the beaver

Basil the beaver

Basil the beaver
Was fed up with wood,
He said it was nasty,
The taste not so good.
He tried eating grass,
But that tasted worse,
And he couldn’t eat flowers,
The bees got there first.
The rocks and the stones
Were too hard to gnaw,   
And he hated the dirt
That he found on the floor,
Basil the beaver
Admitted defeat,
He’s not very happy,
But wood’s all he’ll eat.
