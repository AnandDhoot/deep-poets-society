Music Of The Spheres

Where the sun stops
And the light fades,
And the dark deepens
One finds a subtle
Horizon rest-

Within this symphony
Of great spheres-
Strings aloft,
Horns a summit of air,
Percussionists not a beat
To flare-
Safe harbor, so to speak-
A point
Without a peak...

For Time has no say,
With cycle in pure alignment,
The movement paused
Defying slip or stray,
The conductor's wand not a sway-

Here I also find You,
In the still
Without space,
Suspended
On High of Graceâ€¦
