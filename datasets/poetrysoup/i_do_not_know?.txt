Memories

These memories will call me 
when you let a scene unfold
When strips of me you tore drift apart,
and waves in you atone…
Pardon me,
I cannot leave.

I hear you carved a set of our dreams 
to splitting ends,
That peer on chance 
and creep on our 
enemies’ sweltering intent…
Like you I know,
we dream in years.

I exhale despair and each time 
I swear I’ll die
Of simple charm and terror
embedded in a wince…
Around these spheres we break,
a listless haze shall streak,
In splintered circles and moons
that time shall deem reduced…
For goodness’ sake,
we find them whole.
