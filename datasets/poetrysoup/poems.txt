To Robert Burns

I was thinking how he would live in a farmhouse like this!
Where was the plough? And where was the stable?
Where was the desk for writing poetry?           

In the wooden door? Or next to the window?
When did the mouse come out?           
Would it be in the shadow of the oil lamp reading the poetry?
Or going to the yard to see roses?

Where was the rose?
Could her red be seen in the moonlight?
How much of the moonlight awakened the louse?           
Did it bite? His back? Or his head?           
At that time, was he writing a poem?
Writing what?
Man's man for A a that
Or Tam O Shanter?

What aroused his tender feelings like water?
Was the battle of Sherramuir? 
Or Ae Fond Kiss?           
How did he sing?           
The Auld Lang Syne?!
