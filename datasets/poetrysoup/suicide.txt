Zero's Messiah

As I walk back through a lifetime nearing no tomorrow
I stumble over its worthless purpose with little time to borrow
Searching my legacy's significance of failing as her hero
I am finding the value of my existence has equaled less than zero

Her opinion of me as trust's betrayal is the burden in my hand
Meaning nothing to her but a dark memory has become more than I can stand
Revealing the secret of 'eternally hers', she has missed her most crucial mistake
To possess a place in her cherished heart is a chance my soul will take

Serving as zero's salvation, by raising its value and relieving its shame
My imprint in the sands of time will sadly take its blame
History has kept it from itself as ignored and disregarded
My loss of forgiveness for myself will leave zero forever rewarded

My walk has served its purpose of reassuring my curiosity
As the nothing that I have been reduced to, is born from animosity
Mistaking my burden as her loathing of me, I have come to realize
It's the deserving hatred for myself that has lead to my demise

Less than zero with decreasing value, erased from all her fears
I am ever closer to my place in her heart as my darkness nears
Consolation's prize I wear without pride, as its weight has taken me down
My service in solitude as Zero's Messiah, will take on its worthless crown
