Normal Or Not

Normal Or Not 
 
Normal is a setting on a appliance.
I wish I could turn that dial. 
Today I want to be normal.
Flip the switch laugh, 
flip frown. 
Smile Dance be yourself 
“Yeah right be normal.
Individuality will bring,
the world crashing down
Be like everyone else."
“What if I don’t want to.”
You only have three settings:
Happy, Sad, and, Normal.
“You are not allowed to be anything else.”
“Can’t I be original, unique?
“No.”
“Oh.”
