Suppose to be the ship of dreams

I can still smell the fresh paint from walking on to the ship. So as I walk on the ship, through the halls, it was all new. The sheets had never been slept in, and the china hadn't been used yet. I felt like it was a slave ship taking me back home in chains. All though when I walk into my room I could smell red roses, freshly picked from a rose garden. Now as the engine starts up, I could feel the propellers start to move the ship. As I settle in my room, I feel more anxious to want to leave instead of stay. As the night sets, I walk on to the deck of the ship. I see the beautiful ocean as the ship sail's across the ocean, with the moon and star's, light shinning on the ocean's waters, it looked so beautiful. I can feel the air blowing in my face as I stand on the deck, while the ship is in full speed. I have a terrible feeling come over me, as I try to sleep in my room. All I can see is the every day people talking about the same things over and over again. I feel like a slave that has too sit up straight and not slouch, and I can't be happy I have to be serious all the time. I felt like I was the broken ship, wanting to jump off the ship. Then the ship crashed and all I hear is people crying for help and, the ship is sinking and all I can think of is all of those lost souls, so innocent not knowing what was going to happen to them. Now the ship has sunk and all the people are yelling for help but no one comes because its too late for them so after awhile i can't hear them yelling out any more, then a light shines and I have been saved. Saved from all the pain, and all of the suffering from being a slave. I'm free now free like a bird, I'm freed from all of the pain.
