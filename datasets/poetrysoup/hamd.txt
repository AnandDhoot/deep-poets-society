Let Me

If there will be, let me have your time 
Let me hold your hand as you are mine
And I’ll let you marvel on me like masterpiece 
Take your chance to sculpt me like I'm made to be yours
Do not rush to pass every minutes that will be spend
Detailed, deep, and rave let me be my selfish me 
So I may perfectly surrender to selfless you
A queen to your empire’s enemy let me 
Then breathe with the greatness you shared with me.
