AUTUMN BREEZE



                            AUTUMN BREEZE 

         Leaves murmur, flowers shiver on touch of Autumn breeze
          Heart-piercing passion, emerald emotion I wish to release.

          Started calm cool carefree breeze
           Quite soft pleasant soothing,
           Mild touch and smooth breathing
             Gentle breeze blowing at ease.
             Flowers welcome humming bees.
              sweet scent special something.
            
                      Autumn breeze carries
                ardent aroma clean fresh.
               Rains left showering dry Earth.
             Torn pieces of clouds
            roaming as pretty posy
            on sunlit bright azure sky.
