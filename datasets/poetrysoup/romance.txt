Peaches

Was lonely like a man who sits on a throne,
Who has never felt a kiss on a collar bone.
Feeling departed I found myself at a party
Exploring a girl like she was an African Safari. 
She got me writing novels 
With a lustful theme,
And taking entire naps without a single dream. 
Now when I write poems
I don’t have to steal,
Because the words I can feel
And what I say is real. 
She even has me talking to myself
On public transportation.
Driver thinks I’m crazy,
He asks me for registration. 
We go through the peaches and cream
As though it was rehearsed. 
In the past it fell apart
As though the peaches were cursed. 
After a couple years 
The peaches became sour;
Tried to spend time together,
But we counted the hours. 
My success came from a fear
Of being nobody,
Coupled with a fear  
Of seeing her with somebody. 
Now I write against time
And to the tune of two clocks. 
The words are so important 
That I need a soap box. 
You light up the darkness 
That I could not handle. 
In my depression
you were my candle. 
I want to end this poem,
But I know your friend is not your friend. 
I still struggle with a hope
That you and I will make amends. 
Now in a state of mind
Where I’m doing things
On the edge of scary.
The pain you put me through 
Inspired me to be revolutionary. 
Pain made my words flow smooth,
They seem more Veteran.
It makes me smoke so much weed,
My diet seems more vegetarian. 
Must forget about you,
And all the pain you put me through. 
I want to revolutionize peace,
So people have to hear me speak;
Ideas permeating slow 
Like the broken window theory. 
Still thoughts of you make me speculate
On where my mind was at 
When your words carried so much weight.
My life is at the age
Where I can truly understand
That love is women’s revenge on man. 
Love became a game so cut throat,
It often had me sweating
In a desert with a coat. 
It had me in the club,
With a soar throat and singing the blues. 
I sung about how reality
Is often the bearer of bad news. 
Like a chore
I would often schedule time to ignore you.
Like a child I had to grow up
To realize how much I adored you.
