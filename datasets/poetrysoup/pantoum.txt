Why oh why

he sits, with his head in his hands 
remembering how love had been, 
now, because of his stupidity 
he was on his own again 

remembering, how love had been, 
behind the bars he now called home, 
he was on his own again, 
realising, he was a fool 

behind the bars he now called home, 
his mind, aflame with regret 
realising he was a fool, 
to have stabbed her to death. 

his mind aflame, with regret 
why... did he buy a knife that day...why 
to have stabbed her to death 
because she had found another beau 

why... did he buy a knife that day...why 
now, because of his stupidity 
because she had found another beau 
he sits, with his head in his hands
