Days are expensive

Don’t waste your day
Days are expensive
Don’t taste the error of casualness 
Because casualness leads to casualties who 
Never realized that the days are expensive
It cost the sun and the moon
It cost oxygen…

Be the one who pays attention today
Let the hour reveal
The power of appreciation!
Magnify your skill today
Because days are expensive so
Learn to use them wisely
The day has a purpose so
How can you live the day
If you don’t have a purpose
Life can’t be wasted

Find a way and let
The days reveal you and your talent!
