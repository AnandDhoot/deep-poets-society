OCTOBER FEAST OF WINDS

I hear the heavy breathing through my trees
And Acorns angering the rooftop slate
Whilst winds invade the Caribbean seas
The hurricane metes out the islandsâ€™ fate

The sunlight plays on sturdy trunks of day
And limbs, they wave, with friendly Southern charm
Whilst clouds do heighten the fear on display
The cataclysm of the seas does harm

I see the tickle of the Autumn leaves
The feast of nuts below my cushioned feet
Whilst anchored palms are torn apart by thieves
As lions roar, the land declares defeat
