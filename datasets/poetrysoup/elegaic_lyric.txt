On Fate

Fate looks like a self willed woman
She always gently come to you
She clings to your shoulder when you are depressed
While remaining silent once smug with you!          

She always be there with you
Never abandon to follow

She may like an ordinary countryside flower,          
And could also be an elegant gentle girl         
She always love to set the rhythm to your life
Made you choose either pain or happiness unable
