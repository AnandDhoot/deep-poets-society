"Mas Tacos Por Favor" As she slings her hands back and forth on the dough 
" Mas Tacos Por Favor" As she gracefully accepts the water on the dough
 "Mas Tacos Por Favor" As she gently places her fingers and kneads the dough Just Once she says her in heart..They will Know Mas Tacos Por Favor... 
Just Once they will know the hearts of hard immigrant hands and the gentle tears that stain these lands..
Just Once they will know what it is like to be told you don't look Spanish.. 
Just Once they will know what it is like to have to deceive appearances by looking as if....acculturate and assimilate 
Just Once they will be mindful of how they eat our food and laugh at our hearts.. Just Once again on the corn grinder to make the edges perfect...
