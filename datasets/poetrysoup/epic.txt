Escape from hell

a day will come 
when all my anguish
will vanish
and my sadness
turn into happiness
free from the whips and chains
which feeds me with pains
far will i be
from the land 
of hatred and jealousy
from the life which inflict me 
with emotional agony
and cloths my path 
with tragedies and mysteries
lay me a bird of cruelty
but a day will come 
when time will look 
at me with sympathy
when life will smile at me
for success will be my lover 
and failure my enemy
a clean spirit 
do not have a place in hell
for heaven is the place he dwells
so poverty i wish you farewell
because am departing from hell
and heaven is my next destination
away from the discrimination 
and the intimidation
when that day comes
my night will turn to a day
and the sunshine
will make me a hay
i will enjoy the fruits
of my labor
have happiness every dinner
for i have reached the land
of joy divine
all all that is beauty
now is mine
wonderful thought seducing me
to my prosperity
for birds only fly
and that is their destiny
i am a mansion
built with wisdom
and furnished with freedom
the doors of my heart
opened to the future
and my hunted past gone forever
escaped from the land of fear
i now live where 
life is very fair
conquered the psychological welfare
in my struggle
have i learnt something
nothing can compare
i don't walk with hate
but now walk with faith
