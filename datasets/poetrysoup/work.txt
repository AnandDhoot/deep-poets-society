Drone


I'm the drone who flew away
from the instinctual imperative
of the hive
Doing the same old same ole
just to survive
wasn't how I was going to 
circumnavigate my life
I had a comfy job
with a golden parachute pension
But money don't mean a thing
when you have a lot of internal dissension
Walked away from the condo
and the two luxury cars
Which brought tears to my model class wife
Was a material witness
to a systemic breakdown
Sometimes you have to be brought low,
before you can soar into the clouds
Yes, I'm the drone who flew far away,
away from the maddening crowd
The one who're conditioned 
to run the rat race
I wish them well,
but there's nothing 
you can offer me
to take their place
