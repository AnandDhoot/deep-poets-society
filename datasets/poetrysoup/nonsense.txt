Jack is back


Jack’s been missing of late
Checked at the pearly gate
He wasn’t there
(a minor scare —
does have a future date)

Sure missed the son-of-a-gun
Blowhard, so full of it (fun)
I asked our friend Judy
and old Howdy Doody,
they said, “Jack’s on the run”

After a look in the chunnel
I found him at Cosmofunnel
Let’s lim’rick attack
and get our Jack back
Pin him here with a trunnel.

Jack said he’d return to the soup
if I did, the wacky old poop
So here I am
one silly ham.
Bring it on you goofy fruit loop!
