If I Shopped For My Spouse Like I Shopped For My Automobile


Before beginning my search,
I realize there are many models,
its not easy for anyone,
      even a savvy girl.
      Does he make me twirl,
   will it be a throw of the dice,
   I check out his "sticker price!"
Does he have a warranty to research?

I check out all of his review,
and his history in the world,
his finances, any crashes?
      I am no mystic,
      although not materialistic,
   I have no intention of falling,
   for a lemon, always stalling!
Is he a shining example to choose?

I will give him a test drive,
for a drive in the country,
down a highway we will roar.
      See if he overheats,
      does he have a cozy seat,
   Okay, so all good so far it seems,
   oh, yes he is my dream!
Any weird on line stuff still alive?

Has he a lifetime warranty, free!
Perhaps he will rust out before me,
perhaps he is not worth the price.
      Well, I finally decide,
      hope I got one with pride.
   If not there is a trade in,
   possibility, and then again I begin!
Oh, are you the right model, guy for me?

I promise to take care, I do,
to caress you every day,
to keep you out of rain and snow.
      We will go out often too,
       I will never leave you,
   illegally parked, never will that be,
   part of your life, my shining Cherokee!
Except if we crash, then you are history, adieu?
