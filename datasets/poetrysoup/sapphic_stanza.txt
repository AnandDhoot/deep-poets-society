CATCH MORNING’S DEW, BECOME BEAUTIFUL YOU

 Rise and shine with dawn’s cockerel crow, while most
          slumber laze in dreams. The chill breeze, inhale deep,
          for freshest airs, like minty breaths, enhance youth
          So catch the morn’s dew.

          Go dip with sea, ride zesty wave, absorb verve
          Feel its energy, pulsing through, declare life!
          Growing bright, as sun twinkles warmly, become
          more beautiful you.
