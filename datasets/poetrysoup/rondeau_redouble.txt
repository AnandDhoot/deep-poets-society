POETRY'S LIMERENCE

Limerence lulls liminal zones
Lost in a world of poetry
Alluring melodious tones
Rhyming since little nursery

Most deem it all a drudgery
Unless to music, one intones
Words beating humdrum symmetry
Limerence lulls liminal zones

Other artists say, poets moan
Painting pain with quills so dreary
For insane fans who read and groan
Lost in a world of poetry

Truth in lines can look real bleary
Why not leave well enough alone?
Yet aligned, they ring with fiery
Alluring melodious tones

Growing as nature, skipping stones
Loveâ€™s expressions and flattery
Seem buried deep as those birthed bones
Rhyming since little nursery
                              Limerence lulls
