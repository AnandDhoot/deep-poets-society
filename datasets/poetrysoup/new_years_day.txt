Not Knowing When Where Or How

Tonight I sit here all by myself
Knowing full well I could be some wheres else
Listening to music and partying it up
I can see why New Years Eve gets all the fuss
Out with the old year and in with the new
I never felt so blue
Sitting here thinking how bad I treated you
So I am drowning my sorrows with hard alcohol still waiting for your call
But you don't call
I found out later you just take 1/2 a bottle of Xanax that's all
Must have put you right to sleep 
All because I broke up with you last week
Man I can't even eat
You've been in a coma for a week
What do I do I am so screwed
I am so worried and things are starting to get blurry
I shot another shot and out the door in a hurry
I start my car and there are snow flurries
But it's ok now I don't have to worry
My car looks so curvy
Wrapped around this telephone pole in the flurries
As I watch the Paramedics take my body out on a gurney
D.O.A. I hear them say
I guess I just passed away
