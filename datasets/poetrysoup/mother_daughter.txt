The Visit.

Let me take your photograph I'll put it in a frame.
I'll stand it on my mantelpiece to remind me when you came.
It's not often that you visit or even stay for tea but I would
like to thank you for spending it with me.
You always seem so busy and don't take time to play.
I know it's something special you took time out for me today.
You came to say "Hello mum" you even brought a cake.
I made some tea for you and me as you realised your mistake.
You said that you were sorry for leaving things too long a time.
You promised that you'd visit more, my precious and lovely
daughter. Forever in this heart of mine.
