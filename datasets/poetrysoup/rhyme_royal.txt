My brother

My brother is shield for me
he is in any field with me, 
I love my brother
also my father & mother, 
sometimes he's fighting
sometimes not, 
sometimes he's smiling
sometimes not, 
He is naughty very much
he is funny very much, 
He talks to everybody friendly
& solve the problems easily, 
He is gift to me from God
give him all things, I wish my God.
