 Echo Calling

Why so elusive?
Must you always play 
Hide and seek?
Has anyone ever 
Found you in nature? 
Do you call 
Near or far, dear echo?

Oh, how your ghost haunts
The wilderness, the plains 
And beyond
I've chased after you
Into empty rooms 
And out to fields 
We once walked among

You've answered 
When I softly whispered
To the howling, chaotic wind
You've answered 
When I clapped and hollered
When I tinkered loudly

Once, I've heard your call
When I banged a rod
Against a guard rail
I've chased after you
But you disappeared
Into a thick, blinding fog

I've tracked and traced 
Your mimicking sound
Only to end up smack-dab
In the middle of nowhere
I've faithfully followed 
The trajectory 
Of your reverberation 
But sadly, a gust of wind
Steered it off course

Why so elusive?
Must you always play 
Hide and seek?
Has anyone ever 
Found you in nature? 
Do you call 
Near or far, dear echo?
