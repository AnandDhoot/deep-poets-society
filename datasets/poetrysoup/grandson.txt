Oh, my fuTure grandson may your 
days be filled with miRrth…may the creator 
of the universe smile upon your bIrth…
I dream of Swaddling you and holding you tight…
safe and sound in mama’s belly, a couple more monThs,
You are blessed,  alreAdy, surrounded by love…
May the sun always shiNe brightly on you from above
So many await to welcome you into the world!



BY soon to be,
 Granma Jill
