Kid around

Mist on the park you remind  me of home
My home, an old home, long land of white cloud 
Wistful regret of a lost rolling stone

Blurry strained view of a new weekend’s crowd
Next door to a dream in an awakening tide
Decorum with caffeine but overly proud

Soupy thick bawls exit mouths on the side
Ball mired heavy drives moist huff and puff
Back of the net with a trip and a slide

Carousel balance scares adult voice gruff
Punctures the air with familial line
A stumbling giggle is grabbed by the scruff

Place hands on your hips and presence of mind
Be kind and mop up with a waste of time weave
There’s wet on the slide and damp kid behind

Layers of grey fade where light looks to reeve  
Raising the white flag for surrendering dew 
Disappointed departure like cold on a sleeve

Jump off the swing and a left behind shoe
