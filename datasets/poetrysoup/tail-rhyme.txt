Edinburgh

Muscularity slowly flexing with a calling permanency, 
Permission without clicking that the doorstop’s gone, 
Inherent hardiness springs you into moderation,
And the Castle’s protective rock scatters criminalisation bon. 

Lighter shade of grey without looking aside, 
Whilst the age’s statues beg for what’s in your mind, 
Tidier than the rest, clean enough to prove inspection, 
Of calamity there is no trace or distant recollection. 

Roadways trade the fair, negotiating each time,  
Dismissing treason and rejecting isolation’s stare, 
Lights welcome you in even when prohibition wins, 
Blackbirds dance a chatter about your grins. 

Square set, known symmetry furnishes the town, 
Derived from that castle rock, cool and the mound,
Your spider web is unwoven by the city’s calming sense, 
And then glancing, you leave that web upon the fence. 

Rude city by obviation, defences up, guarded centre, 
Edinburgh Castle is the statue of liberty, our pride, an adulation, 
Even though she signifies fierce battle with the English, 
Our heritage is stillness, gritty integrity and tight courage. 

To become independent would just be bliss, 
And I must kiss this vigorous youth, this promise of prosperity, 
First the Close’s, then from your garments on the back roads, 
Now it’s time to cruise ablaze through the street lodes.
