A Night Unlike Others

There's no bizarre wind 
That disperses the frozen clouds,
And yet every naked tree
Makes horrendous sounds;
No stars rise from the dark sea,
lmoonlight is absent, it feels cold.

The reefs aren't of soft silver, 
They miss the moody moon
Over the deserted lagoon
And the harsh wind of winter;
Many unhappy lovers 
Stare from lit windows 
covered with glittering frost...
They dream of pretty snow
And chestnuts that roast
To uplift a spirit that's low.

It's a frigid October night, 
Cymnies puff with smoke,
Infants cling to mothers:
Tender and gracious scenes
That even Rafael would love
To paint by dim candlelight. 

If his interest is rather small,
Prospective may also fail;
His work of ideas so genial
will be put off for days,
And instead of painting
graceful and divine faces,
unwillingly he'll paint those 
Cast In the depths of Hell

If this is a night unlike others,
Why wolves hide in dark caves
And refuse to gather fleeing
The eerie darkness that makes
Their skin shiver under warm fur.
Perhaps they feel lost thinking
Of the adventure it won't spur,
Of the howling that won"t occur.

Then all fearful humans might plot
Including me who terribly shakes
Wishing that no October night
Would allow the presence of demons,
Of creepy creatures that seem myths.
