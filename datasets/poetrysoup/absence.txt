Dear Daddy

I miss the times we used to share
When I was young, you were always there
I miss your smile, I miss your laugh
The jokes you'd play on my behalf

I miss you each and every day
I miss the way we used to play
I miss the hugs, I miss your love
The way you raised me high above

I miss the walks we used to take
The way you laughed at my mistakes
I miss the drives, you drove so wild
I miss the time I was a child

I miss your pancakes on Sunday mornings
The games you'd create when it was pouring
I miss the fights when it would snow
I hate it that you chose to go

I wish i could talk to you every day
I wish I knew what words to say
I wish I was still that little girl
The girl that seemed like your whole world

Yet I still keep you in my heart
No matter how long we are apart 
But I'm older now and I must learn
That love is something felt not heard
