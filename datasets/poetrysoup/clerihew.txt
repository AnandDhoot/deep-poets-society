This Clerihew's For You


Don't cross swords with A Poet Destroyer,
pretentious jousts really do annoy her
Her weapon of choice: a crossbow or a saber
she'll Cupid your mind, turn your rhymes to confetti paper


Dedicated to Poet Destroyer for being the first one to welcome the Romantic Warrior to the Poetry Soup community. Much love to you.
