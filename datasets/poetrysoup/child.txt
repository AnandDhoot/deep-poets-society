YOU ARE NOT

YOU!
Yes you, if you were still here I'd yell at you
I'd go to you
I'd look at you and show you I am still here

I am still here
YOU ARE NOT

YOU!
Yes you, the one who made me sit like this
made me feel like this
You did NOT make me
I made me

I am still here
YOU ARE NOT

YOU!
Yes you, I won, you see, I won, I have a life
I finally have a life
I don't need to think about you anymore

I am still here
YOU ARE NOT
I hope you rot
