Turning in their graves

I walked past the cemetery the other day,
Those who fought for a right to vote,
Were turning in their graves.
 
I could hear them moaning in their eternal sleep,
Use it or lose it, use it or lose it was their universal call,

Though not scared, I shuddered from top to toe,
At the horror of all horrors,
As I contemplated a world where  voices were long silenced 
By the winds of apathy and contempt for those, 
Past and present Champions of the democratic cause.

A world where democracy was off line.
And yet the people were all oblivious to the fact,
As they took their daily happy pill

Once the shuddering had stopped, 
I stood respectfully and said a silent prayer,
With no words adequate enough to express my gratitude
To all those beautiful souls,
Who deserve to rest in peace. 

I don't know what the caretaker will make of the photocopies of my,
Voting papers on their graves,
But frankly I don't care. 
As if they are ever called forth to reawaken our fading memories
I pity all the non-voters.
