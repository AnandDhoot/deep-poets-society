Lost in this realm

.

Tonight I shall dream of an autumn encounter
Holding my head oh so high to the sky
Finding the north holds my one true desire
Realizing days do not end with good bye

Maple leaves fall in affectionate patterns
Seasoned devotion now scenting the air
Passions are stored in a southern collection
Numbered in order of all that we share

For in my mind I imagine horizons
Borderline longings our footprints will trace 
Oceans of fresh water rippled sensations
Plaid flannel shirts that are worn in this place

Poetic pleasures to breathe in her writing
Softly they whisper, caressing my skin
Long in between yet so worth the time waiting
Closing my eyes hoping words will begin

Here now I stand all alone in this moment
Finding the glow of your smile on a star
Feeling your touch in a moon beam of quivers
Knowing this dream is wherever you are

Counting the days as the nights become shorter
Riding a cloud in the heavens above
Daring our hearts to be those we can capture
Lost in this realm that is known as our love
