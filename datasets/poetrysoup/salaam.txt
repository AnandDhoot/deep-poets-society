I stood at the end of the age

I stood at the end edges of the times
draw breath in a long weary
I saw the earth's population is very high enthusiasm
welcome fanfare age of globalization

I leaned over the country exhausted
when stumble at the junction of a road
laughter roared to cheers crowded
I saw the earth that barely meets the frayed

I lay there, wedged in the corner of the end of life
I guess override liver congested space in depth
watch the green flies swarming chirpy
around the circumference of the odor was named the world

I gasped when he appeared whisper greetings
crowded into the cavities of no-man's soul
throw the rest of me to the arena of struggle
in the midst of strife porandanya an era
