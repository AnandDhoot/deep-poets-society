Bees

The true title is Honey Bee (since it is an acrostic!)

How busily you work, oh little honey bee,
On waves of breeze beneath blue summer sky,
Nectar seeking for your hive community!
Employing your antenna, you are led to fly
Yonder where flowers' pollen beckons you so sweetly.

Beautiful is she, the flower that at last you spy!
Eagerly you take her nectar, bearing it back home.
Evaporating it with comrades' fanning wings -you've made honeycomb!
