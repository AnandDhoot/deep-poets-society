Snake Eyes


I knew'd you was a snake
when I first saw you
laying your beady eyes on me
You were a grifter on the take,
working a con is what you do
Entry angles is what your lurking eyes see

You got dem snake eyes,
looking for where the tongue should strike
You got dem well thought out lies,
searching for the one you think I might like

You're a pure hustler,
bred through and through
Clipping a mark is the thing that you do best
Treat dem like a buster,
let dem think they're playing you
Get dem looking east while you're heading west

You got dem snake eyes,
always shifting, cold reptilian gaze
You got dem well planned goodbyes,
timed to slither away after starting the blaze

Once you put that smoke in someone's eyes,
they become blind to the fact
they've been duped and were none the wise,
all along it was all just an act

But when you peered at me
with dem predatory snake eyes,
I knew'd right then your history
Even with your human mask on,
I saw right through your disguise
So when you tried to bite me, baby I was gone

Watch out for dem snake eyes,
dem lurking eyes watching you
Be leery of dem snake eyes,
or you might see dem devour you
