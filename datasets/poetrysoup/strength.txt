I Will





I will live to die and die to get to that better place
But I don’t want to die and can’t imagine what I’ll face
I will never stop trying to be vibrant and alive
Hoping to contribute, to flourish and to thrive
I will travel to places that bring me closer to my roots
And walk through miles of terrain till I wear out my boots
I will fall down, I know, but get right up and dust off
Never look back, never look worried, or too far forth
I will suppose rebirth does exist with old soul and new form
No memory of the past and no heart, so I won’t mourn
