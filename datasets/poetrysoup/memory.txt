Memories

Crossroads keep old memories
They are flashbacks in disguise,
Painful memoirs of the past
Keep reliving through my eyes.
Demons sneak by Father Time
To bring me tears of sorrow,
I look up to the heavens
For a sunrise I can borrow.
The demons are determined
I need angels standing guard,
My smile has been broken
and my laughter has been scarred.
My soul starts digging deeper
for a glimpse of golden rays,
Still praying for a sunrise
and for bright and better days.
