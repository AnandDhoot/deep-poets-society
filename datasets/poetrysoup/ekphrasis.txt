The Broken Rest

What of the girl sitting next to him,
	blood and blood,
	the same empty stare,
The coagulant dust, like mud,
	drying
	against these leather orange seats.
"My baby, my baby,
	tafali, tafali alhulu..."
Now what memory will last
	of my mommy's sonorous voice?
Will she return like waves in the night?
Shall I wait forever?
