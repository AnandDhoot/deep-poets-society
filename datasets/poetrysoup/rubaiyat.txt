Moaning To Joe

Good? It is a fable...
The waiter's not able.
See all the plates broken:
food over the table.

The people are threadbare...
The town's poor are all there.
People call for service,
but waiter does not care.

The place is so run down -
the people have a frown.
Query's why it's open?
It's worst caf√© in town.

It needs a refurbish -
disgrace, the plate and dish.
Do not hold your breath, though.
Might it go, Joe?  My wish!
