The Arctic



Stark Arctic vacant for centuries
habitat white fur bears epoch
prom's on ice sheets breeze
cubs in search for mama's barrack 
concurring ice surrenders whistle 
remark the scent of sea lions
nurture's th' cubs haunting an angel
in freezing water bathing, stuns
cleans thou fur splash'd blood mud's
with a long wooden ice pick stick
Eskimo Indians with leather studs
an a husky right beside slick
Eyes wide fur fluff an irresistible speed
chilled they stay like family like bear

Different worlds apply suitability 
passionate to live in thou world 
leave mine an find solidity
among masters of ice pearl'd
like dolphin's feel in th' wide ocean
free spirits eccentric in this world
visual glitters under water at dawn
an sleep by morning sunlight furl
having such power an strength
thou art can't by any means measure 
th' Arctic distance in length 
memorizing thou atmosphere's odour
never enough for my passion to feather
my moral says i have to live there

an you'll probably wish me good luck
