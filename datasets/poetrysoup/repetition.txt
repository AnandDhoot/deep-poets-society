Stop The Bombs

Stop the bombs,
They're killing our future
It’s hard to remain calm,
Forests are gone from fiery napalm.
Where are the natives gonna live?
Something’s got to give.

Stop the bombs,
Radiation lingering around.
Must again purify humanity’s crown.
Stop the bombs
To save the homeless man 
Reading the twenty-third psalm  

One Mushroom Cloud, war could be global.
Nature decayed and fallen out like Chernobyl.
The flash in the distance
Could be His second coming
Or nukes of resistance.
And yet the dove flies overhead

Perhaps its song can hush the war drum.
Dove flying overhead
Maybe it’ll give peace to some.
Dove flying above,
Bombs blasting below.
But let love’s organ blow.

Stop the bombs,
So salvation can abound,
Prayers for mercy sound,
Stop the bombs,
Children are crying on battleground.
May they see a world of peace,
Instead of an earth deceased.
May doves in cages be released.
