A Difficult Topic

 
I never talk about the fact that I am going blind,
it is something I have a hard time dealing with;
really it is best to just put it out of my mind.

If I could make it go away that would be my wish,
no drugs or any operations can cure this girl;
it is something, I have a hard time dealing with.

And while I still can-  I dance and whirl and twirl,
I memorize nature, all the colors and scenes;
no drugs or any operations can cure this girl. 

I keep within my soul all the different greens,
and all the shades of the sky and all the flowers;
for when I am blind, there will still be dreams.

While I can-  I write poems into the small hours,
and when darkness comes, will you read to me?
Read my poems of forests, skies and wildflowers.

While I can-  I write poems into the small hours,
I never talk about the fact that I am going blind.
And when darkness is mine, will you read to me?
Really it is best to just put it out of my mind.
