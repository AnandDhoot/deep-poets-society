Nine Eleven Decade




Information and social information
Facebook, Twitter, Smart Phones.
IPods, IRods and even ARods.
Steroids, Bluetooth and Drones 

I became a rapid change victim
Eaten up by crazy, futuristic innovations,
New order, decree and dictum
Transparent toasters and chicken roasters

Decade of the sane becoming schizoid,
Distant, detached and indifferent
Buddies that I tried to avoid
Like me had their psyche destroyed

Not much need for philosophy,
Ethics, manners, contentment, only worry
Not much time for the Ponderosa Ranch
We were too much in a hurry.

Summer came, 2007, I wrote a letter
To my friend who was disabled 
I put away my IPod and
Listened to Beatles on a turntable.
