Anchor

It's the way they look at me.
As if I haven't lost my hair.
It's the way they play with me.
As if I were their age.
It's the way they worry about me.
As if that's what should be done for my scars.
It's the way they tell me I'm beautiful.
As if it's common knowledge.
It's the way they hug me.
As if I'm their anchor to this world
When in actuality, it's quite the opposite.
