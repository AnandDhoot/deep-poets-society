Beneath the Elder Trees

What creeps in space beneath the Elder trees
   where time exists unfettered misting shore
   that haunts and howls yet never says what for
   as unborn twins that rot in garbled seas?
Whose breath turns stale an autumn mystic breeze
   then speaks of life remembered ripe with gore,
   of lust and death all stemming from a whore
   who swiped a card to pay her selfish fees?
When rolling fog turned damp the summer air
   while moon-lit skies exposed a mother’s tomb
   then infants torn in half made heartfelt pleas
   that fell on deafened ears which didn’t care;
The slain that rest now freed from Satan’s womb -
   What creeps in space beneath the Elder trees.
