HIDDEN GARDEN

“HIDDEN GARDEN”


Here's a story I once heard.
About a rabbit and a little gray bird.
The rabbit left his house one summer morn.
At the top of the hill he could see the famers corn.
There in the middle of all that corn was a rabbits delight.
He could smell that sweet smell but it wasn't in his sight.
Howdie there said the little gray bird as he flew by.
Can you do me a favor go look in the corn from the sky.
He knew there was a wonderful suprize for him to eat.
The little gray bird flew through the fields of corn and wheat. 
OH please tell me little gray bird what do you see.
Hey there rabbit there's a garden for you and me.
They both ran through the corn to see what was there.
They gathered what they could and the rest they would share.
There was a valuble lesson they learned that day.
When friends work together things go their way.
