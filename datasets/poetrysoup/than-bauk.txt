STEPS TO H

Holy men’s guilt
Patchy: quilts of 
Bad, tilting good
        They dish soul’s food
        Bowls gold-hued take
        FEES$, DUE  HEAVEN
		    Priest-hoods, brethren
		    PREACH heathen fears
		    EARTHEN HELL’S FIRE
                                   Soul's fate real dire?
                                   CRY NOT! Hire GOD
                                   HIS IRE, FORGIVES  
                                                 With ease some live
				      	         They kill, give, pray
				                 Relieved, their sins!
