Dear Friend

When bored with a humdrum way,
I think about this happy day
When we went laughing up and down
The magpie streets of Dublin town.

Then it seemed our feet had wings,
Oh the many lovely things
We shared and talked of, you and I
Underneath the Dublin sky.

Through the old town we went, 
So young, so joyful, so innocent.
With our friendship at its prime,
That was once upon a time.

I recall this moment in days of old
When we were so candid yet so bold
With faith afire and heart aglow.
But that, my friend, was long ago.

Those days are gone, but I remember when
You and I promised to meet again.
And while different our lives may have grown,
You are still a friend I can call my own.
