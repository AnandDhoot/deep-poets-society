My Family.

My dad he is a champion
the greatest in his craft.
My mam is soft and gentle
and some times she is daft.
And i look at all the things we've done
the places we have been.
Dad's favourite colours red,
and my mam's was always green.
My brothers tuff and tumble,
my sisters sweet disguise.
I'm ever so humble an element of surprise.
Though I take after my dad
A champion that I am,
and often I do silly things
daft just like my mam.
