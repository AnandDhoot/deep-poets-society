Melancholy Moments

"And so being young and dipped in folly, 
                                            I fell in love with melancholy..."
                                                                        -Edgar Allan Poe
 


Despondent and dismal I’ve gone extinct,
    goodbye to hope, sadness has become grace.
        MELANCHOLY MOMENTS, I take a drink
            cuz’ I can’t forget the look on your face...
               as you held me during our last embrace-
               I lay in woe and drown in addiction,
            but no drug can take away affliction.
        Morose and disappointed I must cry,
    sorrow has become my best constriction-
MELANCHOLY MOMENTS, I hope to die.
