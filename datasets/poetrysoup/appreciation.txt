Adopted Aussie Am I



Adopted Aussie Am I

I came here to Australia
Some fifty years ago
I met a girl in London town
Who really made me glow
She came from Australia
And brought me back with her
And when I landed on these shores
My heart, how it did stir

Surrounded by the ocean
It was so very fine
The beer was extra special
Oh how I loved their wine
The coloured birds they made me smile
And oh, those kangaroos
Everything seemed so relaxed
I loved it, I tell you

So Me I joined the army
To give this land my thanks
Spent a year in Vietnam
Amid those mines, and tanks
Now they’ve put me on a pension
Made me a TPI
They’ve made my life real comfortable
Until the day I die

So Here in west Australia
I love it, really do
I’m glad to be an Aussie
It suits me I tell you
It’s an amazing country
For a guy like me to live in
When I came here, I knew for sure
That I was on a win
