A forgetful hat

A morning it was shining red,
And mister president's black hat,
Was siting on his solemn hair,
As it was not at all aware,
That it's a hat of a fat rat.

By using crown to form its speech,
»Good morning!« Said the hat to each,
Of man that passed its rat called Leech,
And if it had a hand or two,
I'm pretty sure it would bow too.

The hat was eating not that day,
If it was lucky, so to say,
The rat will fed him with some spray,
It did not know although that rat,
Must always have a shining hat.

Hat has not seen a rat or swine,
Its not a pig it is a swine,
That doesn't wear a hat, yet still,
The hat does work without its will,
Without its pride and right to dine.

The rabbit always laughed about,
Those hats which never worn are out,
Now hats have risen. Nevermore,
Will they be greeting like before,
If they are worn they'll rudely shout.

The rats will eat the rabbit scum,
And hats will later on succumb,
For who will laugh when rabbit's gone,
To make them see and then act on,
Remember hats are poor and dumb.

The night it will be shining red,
And mister president's black hat,
Will still be sitting on his hair,
As it will never be aware,
That it's a hat of a fat rat.
