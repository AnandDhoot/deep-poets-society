THE HUNGER ARTIST

MIND OVER MATTER... A VERY SIMPLE WAGE... 
AS A HUNGER ARTIST... I LIVE A WEEK INSIDE A CAGE. 
SIXTY SECONDS IN EVERY MINUTE SIXTY EVERY HOUR. 
JUST A DAY INSIDE THIS CAGE YOU BLOSSOM LIKE A FLOWER. 
FEED ON AIR... DRINK YOUR THOUGHTS... 
REMEMBER BACK WHAT YOU WERE TAUGHT. 
NOW'S THE TIME FOR YOU TO DREAM.  
REACH NEW HIGHS YOU'VE NEVER SEEN. 
I FEEL THE HUNGER... I LOVE IT STRONG.... 
INSIDE THIS CAGE IS WHERE YOU BELONG. 
EMBRACE THE PAIN AT THIS TIME.... 
LET IT TRAVEL THROUGH OUT YOU MIND. 
INSIDE THIS CAGE I CAN SEE, 
WHAT OUTSIDE VIEWERS CAN'T BELIEVE.
REACH FOR HOPE AND YOU WILL SEE, 
THERE'S SOMETHING MORE, IN LIFE YOU NEED. 
WHAT DOES NOT KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONG. 
HELP'S YOU MOVE YOUR LIFE ALONG. 
MAKE YOUR STAND, LIVE YOUR LIFE.
RAISE YOUR ARMS AND CONQUER STRIFE...
SEVEN DAYS HAVE PASSED ME BY... 
AS A HUNGER ARTIST I REFUSE TO DIE....   
I APPRECIATE THIS TIME SPENT WITH YOU. 
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED MY POINT OF VIEW....
