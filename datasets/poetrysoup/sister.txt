Blink

I had a dream last night
that I was five years old
I was taken back to the time
When my house was sold

As I lay there lost within a dream, 
Sleeping in my bed,
Memories of the good ol' days
Circled in my head

I walked a narrow trail not knowing of it's end
Then suddenly between the trees stood my lifelong friend.
I watched as we grew older;
How quickly the time had passed. 
All these years behind us
Had come and gone so fast.

Her graduation day had come;
I'd never been so proud.
When she walked onto the stage that day
All dressed in cap and gown;
I watched and faked a smile
While my whole world turned upside-down.
I realized that this was no dream 
And I couldn't help but think;
Of all these years that passed us by
When all I did was blink
