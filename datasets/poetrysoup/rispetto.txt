Gala Night Of Galactic Lights


Galactic lights lighten up the navy skies,

Clamorous emitters scream and go ka-boom,

These exotic sights lighten my heavy eyes,

Glamorous glitters gleam and glow in the gloom,

Midnight hours twinkle with these meteorites,

Light showers mingle with this shower of lights,

Tarry, this play of lights has brightened my mood,

Starry display of lights has lightened my load.
