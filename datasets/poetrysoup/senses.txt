HEAR EAR

Over recent months I’ve had trouble with my hearing…
Misinterpreting what is being said isn’t so endearing


Take a step back and think of all the things you would miss if you couldn’t hear at all

The list is endless but here are a few I came up with 

The cry of a newborn baby and your child’s first words
The symphony of the dawn chorus
Music and speech on the radio or TV
Phone conversations or chatting with friends
Going to the theatre or to a concert
The door bell or alarm clock ringing

And of course there are those three little words we love to hear …

‘IS DINNER READY ?’

OOPS I MEAN

I LOVE YOU

I took the plunge and saw a specialist and have been fitted with a hearing aid
Wow what a difference it has made

I can hear perfectly now
From the squeak of a mouse to the moo of an old cow

And the best bit of all…

If someone is mouthy and starts to scoff
I can quickly turn my hearing aid off!!!

N B I have to approach what has been and what is going on in my life with humour it is just the way I cope with what life throws my way
