Dairy Of


Would you care to open up your dairy:
the secret thoughts written,
but never said
Do you care to reveal to the world,
the scarlet written words
that recorded the pain
as your heart bled
Would you like everyone to know
of your unspoken desires
Feelings of sunshine and rain
Would it bother you if they knew
why the skeletons in your closet
rattle around so
Would your dairy's final entry
unveil the smoking truth as to why
all those cancerous pent-up emotions,
you could never let them go
