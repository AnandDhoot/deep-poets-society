City Of Trees




I saw one day a city of trees
Walking down a path with me
Following hidden eyes to see

Saplings jungled up together
Like a stream of walkers too
Confused at all by windy weather

Deer pellets scattered walk-aways
Somebody's got to clean that up
Small insects eat away the maze

Emerald canopy of light
Daylight flyers speeding through
Branches complicate their flight 

Crowded young trees struggling tight
Set an arboreal street fight
Leaping tall for teen age light

Botanical light shows in the trees
Sun rays scattering breezily through
Red and green for traffic leaves

Partying fireflies up all night
Celestial revue of starlight bright
Crickets and peepers sing delight

Subway system of crooked holes 
Gophers nudging sexy moles
Touching each other heading home

Spiders vending corpsal flies
In handy snacky six-pack buys 
To homeward-bound commuter eyes

Fauna's eating Flora The Breeze
Loving her out in the hot dry leaves
Completing her lust for life you see

And Green Man is the mayor bold
Dryad, she's his squeeze and maid
Public works by beavers laid

Learning to walk, a child of three
First time I saw the City of Trees
Dryad was holding her hand for me

Dryad, she's my love to be
Taking her inventory of bees
Holding her charms about the trees

So we say and so it seems
City of Trees and sunlight beams
Making love for me and my dreams
