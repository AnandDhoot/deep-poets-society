Broken Chains

There's a confusing yearning inside me 
To have someone caress and touch my body
I crave something I have been taught to deny
Sexual desires are a sin we heard from our rabbi 
To be with someone physically, was only to multiply 
My understanding of sex was there can't b any joy
An act of purpose, otherwise our lives it would destroy 
From when I was little, I felt there was something wrong 
Of wanting a physical connection so strong 
How can God create this feeling within?
If it was such a despicable sin
Learning to give up my body without any guilt 
Was a journey that kept breaking down and had to b rebuilt 
To break free my lustful thought and fantasy
Was healing me from insanity 
It isn't a sin to experience intercourse 
To enjoy sexual arousal without having any remorse 
I am released from the chains that have kept me bound
Freed of inhibitions that have quieted my sound  
I am passionate now and have the ability to feel 
This is life this is sex this is real
