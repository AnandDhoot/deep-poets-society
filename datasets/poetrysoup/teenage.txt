I'm Not Having It


Don't give me that look
     'cause you don't like what I just said
Start taking back all that stuff
     every single thing your sticky fingers took

Don't give me no lip
     what, you want me to crack your head
Go ahead playa, call my bluff
     win yourself a two-week stay-in-the-house trip

All of your friends 
     got more sense than you
They know I ain't the one you can backtalk to
One day you'll learn
     not to go poke the bear
Got yourself lit up, now you can't sit in a chair

If you wanna act like one of BeBe's kids
     remember who you're facing when you sit
Until you man up and get your own digs
     while you live here, I'm not having it
