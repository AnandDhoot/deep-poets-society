I am homesick

I am homesick for heaven
Loneliness is my companion
Looking forward to wedding
With my beautiful Savior...

My heart is really aching
Thirsty is my hurting soul
Even my body breaking
I just want to go home...

Tell me, precious Jesus
How long do I have to wait?
Until You come and get me
And we will celebrate...
