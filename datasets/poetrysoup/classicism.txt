Byron and Dickinson Fire

She was created of earth's lusty marrow,
 lived amidst chimera and heather fields
  breathing Byron essence & Dickinson fire,
there was madness in the poetry of her life
   an atmosphere favorably self-aware 
      mundane was ne'er her cup of fancy

In death, she was found to be quite lucid
'tween exiled days and windswept expanses
   of untrodden woodlands & lone seascapes,
perchance glimpse her twilit ambiance
  whispering beyond breezes of conclusive
   horizons void of derived worldly silhouettes
