Wind and See

So many thoughts breeze through these winds

Echoing........

     Lost in a tailspin 

I close my eyes 

Yet I still see.......

Never knowing which vision is real..
 
But knowing in the future I will be able too see.....

Amazed at the Gift given to me

I cannot change what will come to be....

I will Trust in the Lord with all my Heart....

Each Morning You Restore My Soul.....

An Lead My Destiny......
