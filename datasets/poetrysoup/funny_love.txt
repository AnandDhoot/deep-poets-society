I want to Know You

I want to get to know you more.
You seem like a nice person.
I am not sure if you are into me anymore.
You're actions toward me lately have been poor.
I thought that maybe things would work out.
My friends keep telling me that if you don't like me then you're crazy.
I tell them well there's someone better than me maybe.
Tell me what you want to do because I am so confused.
You tell me one thing but you're actions say another.
Just tell me if you want me to leave and you I won't bother.
