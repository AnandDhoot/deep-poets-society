O My Heart

O how my heart from love seems barred
with my true love away at sea.
Shattered like countless bits of shard—

my heart, each piece, an etched placard
of war’s bold-faced atrocity.
O how my heart from love seems barred!

When thoughts of war's portentous harm
permeate my mind and leave me
shattered like countless bits of shard,

my heart becomes forlorn and marred
as I await our destiny.
O! How my heart from love seems barred,

smitten by increasing alarm,
restive with raw anxiety,
shattered like countless bits of shard;

my dreams become threadbare and scarred.
O Lord in heaven, hear thou me 
of how my heart from love seems barred— 
shattered like countless bits of shard.
