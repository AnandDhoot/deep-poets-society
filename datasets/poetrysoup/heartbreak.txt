Back When We Kissed

Soft hammock gently swayed forgotten mist,
remembered eyes revealed love’s final kiss;
A moment passions swept that mine shall list,
to keep a promise made eternal bliss;
 
In swirls two doves were dancers lost within,
romance unseen forever known as long,
that darkness held lum’nescence viewed had been,
transparent sky where sang our bodies’ song; 

From there now sight reviews rear imagery,
where crystal clear remains an autumn breeze,
when lovers blinked absconded symmetry,
and left behind what calls for lines like these:

May love discovered fill translucent skies,
  For lips embraced as once that closed our eyes.
