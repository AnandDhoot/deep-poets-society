''Colorize The Classics''


A classic that I love is Gone With The Wind,
     the sweeping historical epic,
full of romance and facts of history.
It tells the story of the southern belle, Scarlet,
daughter of a cotton plantation owner, 
  Oh, the tangled love affairs she had,
her secret lover Ashley and the dashing Rhett.
  Breathtaking visually with striking images,
     I think directors are like painters creating.
oh, lets go back to the movie now, the war rages. 

But through war, destruction, poverty and death,
     even the loss of her child,
Scarlet, from spoiled belle to strength,
inspired me so much, the girl in satin dresses,
in one scene in rags, she vows to God, her words.
  "As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again!"
She stands holding the earth of Tara,
  in her hands and looks to the sky.
     And in the very end-  after Rhett rejects her
she says, "I'll think about that tomorrow . . ."
