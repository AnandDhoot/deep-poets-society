Inspired by Zen


May all my hopes and fears dissolve into timeless truth,
May they melt away and trouble be no more,
Let my inner mind gleam, and beam wisely and bright,
And my heart abide neither here or there but 
Arise from anywhere and nowhere!

-Poem inspired by the Shurangama and the Diamond Sutra (Zen)
