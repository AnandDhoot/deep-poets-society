     These vines conceal that mystery 
Of who lies there under the grave,
      Each tombstone has its history,
But this  o l d  one here is her fave;

     She comes here everyday to find 
These vines conceal that mystery,
     Yet they can never ever bind
Her  b y g o n e  but fresh memory;

     She walks through the cemetery 
That houses sad  w e e d y  headstones,
     These vines conceal that mystery,
She finds them strangely overgrown;

     Today, she'll come once more to grieve,
With a red rose solitary,
     They know her tale, but when she'll leave,
These vines conceal that mystery.
