An Eternal Vow

Give me something I that I can hold on to

If I am to lose you now

My heart will implode from desperate sorrow

We promised to be there though to the end, it was an eternal vow

Can you stay? We know we need each other more than ever

I would have you close to protect and always keep you

But you’re slipping away and changing, that hurts the most

You’re not mine however, so what am I to do

It breaks my spirit to have you not know my heart

I should have told you how I still feel it all

You need to know how this wrecks me endlessly

I put up my guard yet over and over in love, I continue to fall

All the shoulds, coulds and woulds

And the past that I can’t change, that is what I would in a second trade

I trust you most and I think of you incessantly

But I find you fading away, what a mistake I have made

You drift closer to the end of your days to leave me behind

Sadness fills me because I cannot follow and time was wasted

Why was I afraid to put my heart in your hands?

Now I cannot be with you and my despair at that cannot be overstated

You look right through me as you lay resting in your bed

It is you I need the most and you know

You have been all I wanted all this while

And today I cling to your hand, as my love continues to grow

When you are gone, I will remember your smile

I will crave your bright glow

Your aura that is irreplaceable and I will find it in no other

I will think of you forever and for all my days it will show
