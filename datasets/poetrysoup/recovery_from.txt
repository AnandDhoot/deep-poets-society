Clear Streams And Dreams Dried Into Ghostly Dust

Clear Streams And Dreams Dried Into Ghostly Dust

I have cried in the silent dark of night;
cut deeply by despair and savage Fate.
Dearest love lost is worse than deathly fright
for its depths brought in misery and hate.

Where, screaming nightmares in howling wind blow;
silent footsteps remind of foolish deeds.
When once, my great pride demanded brutal show,
darkness reign casting its sad, bitter seeds.

What answer, to greatest treasure once lost;
clear streams and dreams dried into ghostly dust.
Can I, buy back at any future cost
deepest of true love and her faithful trust?

Her image, I see in mind cast in gold,
valueless, for such my heart can not hold.
