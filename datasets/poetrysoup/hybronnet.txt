dream catchers


Woven webs artfully crafted.
Hanging charms to capture the ghosts,
weaving into dreams unguarded.
If only I’d had one of those!
They will hold back ghouls malignant,
like loved ones lingering lonely,
waiting for your dreaming moment,
to steal you to their realm, deadly.
T’was told, should spirits start talking,
beware, if they asked you one thing;
that with them, you go, a-walking.
For that meant death, to you, they’d bring.
So at night I would go to sleep,
fretting with what my dreams would reap!

But around were no dream catchers!
They just said, “Take care in your dreams”
This, I thought, a real head-scratcher!
How to sleep with a radar beam?
 My worries and years, slipped away,
my dear friend’s passing, quite forgot,
and as darkness erased the day,
I drifted back to our old spot.
Now what if a dead stranger came? 
How would you know they were spirits?
They said, “All the dead walk the same”
“They float above ground a wee bit”
That night she came as no stranger.
Smiling, I was glad to see her.

“How have you been?” she did ask me
“Well and so happy to see you!”
“I’m very happy too,” said she.
And as she took my hand, the clue,
hit me as I happened to look,
down at the ground and saw her feet.
They hovered! Oh, how my hand shook!
She gazed at me, her face so sweet
“You’re dead, and so must let me go”
I pulled my hand but she held tight.
A weakness grew as my breath did slow.
Struggling to move with all my might,
I woke, sitting up; trembling cold;
both hands gripping neck in choke hold.
