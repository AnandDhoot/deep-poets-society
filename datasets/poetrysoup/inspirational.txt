Speaking

He spoke to the mailman;
He spoke to the driver;
the delivery guy;
neighbor;
stranger......
He spoke to anyone he met,
asking them how they were doing,
or how they were feeling.
One person, though, he forgot to speak to;
he forgot to speak to himself,
and know how he was doing or feeling....
