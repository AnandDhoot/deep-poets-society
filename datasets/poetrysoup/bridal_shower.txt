Say yes to life 
He was in the hospital tubes and oxygen mask
his heart had stopped but the good people had got it going again
Raindrops ran down the window matching his scepticism 
he closed his eyes what`s the point.
When he opened his eyes again sunlight danced on the window, 
he asked wanted to go home, she smiled, doctors smiled
their patient was getting better.
