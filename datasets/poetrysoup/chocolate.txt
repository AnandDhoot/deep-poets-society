Little Minx.

Lollipops, candy bars and chocolates galore
all sorts of colour and mixtures
in Mac Henry's store.
The aroma of sweetness
flying around that place
as I press against the window
when Mac Henry saw my face.
Scram, scram I'll tell yer mam
if you don't go away.
Every morning I look out
your face is pressed this way.
You ogle and ogle for candy bars
but never money to pay.
So scram, scram, says Mac Henry
and chases me off for the day.
But I'll be back tomorrow. hee, hee.
