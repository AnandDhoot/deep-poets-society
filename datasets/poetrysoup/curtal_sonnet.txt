OLIVE EYES

                                    I like the smell of coffee
                                      in the morning
                                      with lace gentled sunlight
                                      creeping
                                      through open windows.
                                      And I like olive eyes.

                                      I like lakeside afternoons
                                      surrounded by roses
                                      and sunlit breezes,
                                      coolwarm touches
                                      on my heart.
                                      And I like olive eyes.

                                      I like evening conversations
                                      conveyed
                                      with bliss sparkling eyes,
                                      words revealed
                                      that could not be said.
                                      And I like olive eyes.

                                      I love glowing nightfalls
                                      and quiet passions sensed,
                                      absorbed
                                      in every caring touch, and given
                                      with hopes of more to come.
                                      And I love olive eyes.
