RESIGNATION



                                                        RESIGNATION

                     Rushing on action?
                     Expecting conflict?
                     Showing ego?
                     Inevitable outcome?
                     Growing monotony?
                     New venture?
                     Avoiding confrontation?
                     Tough situation?
                     Interest lost?
                     Over-reacted on difference of opinion?
                     Nothing: But whims.
