Winter Snow.

A blanket of snow has fallen from the sky
it's a tapestry perfect pure white.
It's covered the roof tops, bushes and trees
and everything within its sight.
It must have fallen from dusk to dawn
with no evidence of it to cease.
It's a relentless sky dropping flakes from on high
as the earth is clothed in a blanket of peace.
Two foot of snow has fallen 
and there's news there is more to come.
I can only sit and wonder how deep it will be
before it is done.
I wonder how long I'll be trapped in my home
a week, a month I fear.
Then I hear on the news by this time next week
the roads will once again be clear.
