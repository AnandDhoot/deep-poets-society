RED NIGHT RITES

Calabash cracks
On the frond chair
Splinters

Black sash, then sparks
Tooth, bone and hair
Whispers

Patter-patter
Footfalls on stone
Midnight

Blood moon and fog
Shadows haunting
Mist-white

White dress, bare feet
Root, footâ€¦ slipped
Whimpers

Neck and wrist slit
Wine of soul, spilled
Sputters

Dawn and duskblade
Spell rites fulfilled
Appeased.
