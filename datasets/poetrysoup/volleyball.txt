Little Change

The day started with the teams made
but as one girl heard the news,
she just wanted to fade
fade like an old bruise

She knew her team wouldn’t
Let her be who she wanted
As they thought she couldn’t
Have any skills that she never flaunted

The games had started 
But the girl was stuck at the start
The others hadn’t parted
For her to play smart

They were strict
But then there was quite a change
Not as focused on being perfect
The girl was let play, it was strange

But then she realized
They did it so the teacher 
Wouldn’t noticed her cries
And see her as a caged creature

She tried to change things 
And they kind of did
But all was lost as she sings
About the unfairness she almost undid
