Smiles Of Joy

A man once said see My Roof Garden
Where coexistence begs no pardon
In Consciousness you will be aware
Of Collaboration of all plants there
They all will travel the same Road Of Life 
Bring smiles of joy and never strife

Single

A single flower in a wilderness growing
A single bee pollenating seeds a sowing
A single breeze blows through the air
Single seeds scattered everywhere
Where once was wilderness a single garden now
Gods work is done without a single plough
Single things turned into many
It did not cost a single penny

So The F.A.

So the F.A. Think once then they think twice
Now the new England manager is Sam Allardyce
Is this the right choice will come the call
 For domestically he ain't won a trophy at all
He only knows how to avoid relegation 
So is this too big a job yes in my estimation
We'll only find out in the qualifiers ahead
Then at the world cup we will be left for dead

Questions

Where are you headed he enquired?
When will you again be desired?
Why would you go so far away?
How can you leave here today?
Who is it that you are going to meet?
What are you looking for love oh so sweet?
Which way can I change your mind?
Questions but answers he just cannot find

Terrorists

The terrorists come out to play
So we stay indoors today
We let them win if we stay home
We should go out and we should roam
For freedom ours forever more
They'll never kill it they can be sure
