Eternally

You're so distant and quiet
not like you used to be with me.
I feel like you're slipping away
like I'm losing you, you're fading.
My mind can never forget you
nor my heart beat without you.
I'd give anything if you were happy
if you loved me as before.
Tell me what to do my love
I'll die doing what it takes.
I promise I'll love only you
by my side and even if not.
No one else can fill me up
and complete me like you do.
I am yours eternally.
