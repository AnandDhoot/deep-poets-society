Kalamatsch

As a kid I played with mud in pouring rain
                                     sand and water and hands no box required
we called it ‘kalamatsch’ quite crafty fun
                          as in kala and free play never reasoned or planned

Cowboys and Indians followed later and
                                   luckily ‘Winnetou’ was the good protagonist
but then Karl May the resourceful author 
                               had never been to places he simply studied in

In the Army to my shame it was tactics and
                                    strategic endeavours with bad Russians the
scapegoats mocked in cold wars heating up
                                  little soldiers and regiments moved round in

I renounced my allegiance as Hippies caught
                               up with me with flower power and grass roots
hair down to the hips rolling in the clouds and
                                muck of the times where right became wrong

Che Guevara and Ho Chi Minh appealed when Mao 
                                              proposed to destroy what destroys us
when Marx and Freud knew it all and My Lai
                              glowed in agentic orange shadowed burns on her

Beach holidays followed with grain and salt ocean
                            dunes foreshores boundless sex near the tide line
breeze in our hair winds of change repressed
                               and tormented boxed in and neglected adapted

As life passes by and remembrance projects in
                             present and future the stenosis of sand timers
narrows regulated trickles turns oases to desert
                               low lands to flood plains and money to greed

It is never too late to have a happy childhood
                           in which adults abide by young people’s wisdom
cast away pragmatic self-indulgence where youth
                            is no crime and rigid seniority is not in itself an

I long for ‘Kalamatsch’ that does not muddy the 
                    waters where sand is just sand when it runs through 
my fingers where rain is not acid and I can create and 
              restructure thick planks into olive braches not restrained

Framed as enclosure’s restrictions misguided control of
                       surveiled subjugation of collateral damage skinned 
dreams falsified in books burning but rather where the
