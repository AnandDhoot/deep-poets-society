Life in a hum drum town

Strip malls and fast food chains,
a sidewalk sign spinner entertains,
cashiers repeating "have a nice day",
schools out and kids want to play,
advertising boards and neon lights,
beckoning the poor, the rich and socialites.

Passing trucks with full beam headlights,
makes no difference day or night,
pan handlers begging at the junction,
people stare with skeptical presumption,
speeding motorists and blaring music,
some people are just rock bottom basic.

Wearing pajamas at the local store,
lazy attire not to be seen on a dance floor,
skimpy shorts and saggy pants,
modern costumes make a fine romance,
parents shouting and kids crying,
windy days and fluffy clouds flying.

In shadows, drug addicts paying for a score,
an entitled generation demanding more and more,
people needing some fix to fill their lives of despair,
watching T.V, cellphone in hand, sat on an armchair,
listening to stories from the old timers,
on lazy afternoons during the hot summers.

Noisy ball games in the local parks,
everyone knows their local landmarks,
walking the dog in the parks and streets,
sports fans wailing at their teams defeat,
a small corner in a dreary hum drum town,
hopeful weekends, Monday begins a countdown.

Mowing the yard, avoiding the fire ants,
checking the newspaper for local events,
fishing on the banks, enjoying ones solitude,
a couple of days rest and feeling renewed,
life is the same in most towns and cities,
full of stories, poems and cheerful ditties.
