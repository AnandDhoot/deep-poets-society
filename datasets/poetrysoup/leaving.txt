Fatherless

Fatherless

Faded pictures and moments of disguise. Wanting only the skies limit, for these words may appear to be quite timid, but where are you?  Pursue the pursuit of happiness, of just being one in life. Joy filled days and nights of all we could share. Is it fair, when no one is there? When there is nothing, to do but stare out into the wilderness, and in vision such a place, where you stood. The strength that was given to you, but it abandons you when it comes to us. Lost in a system of hopes and dreams. Wanting to be wanted, yet no one seems to understand. Braved it all alone, as the wind shatters, these tears for all to see. Calling out your name. Not in vain, as so many may claim. Insanity it could be, but the hope still remains. Dangerously close to the edge, of this unknown cyclone of feelings, dealing away the pain. These house of cards have falling. Stalling as the storm urges on. Father were have you gone?
