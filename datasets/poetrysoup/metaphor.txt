How else do we prop a leaning tower

How else do we prop a leaning tower?
Pull it down?    Root and roof and all 
falling, crush roaches and rodents—
aliens without a fatherland.

Leeches and suckers, they're. Carriers 
of malaria, bloated tummies, fire red.
Hawks and vultures, hovering for carcass; 
babblers, shrinking common coffers 

with glee till the tower crumbles;
till they turn dumb. A peacock in borrowed 
rainbow feathers, strutting. A white rooster 
crowing at dawn with delight, 
but cooing his dirge.

Will wind of fire fan a preening bird on 
a perch? Will storm spare a lone Iroko 
in a forest of shrubs; or soldier ants, 
a tramping foot? 

Digging deep, plumb and level in hand! 
Dressed stone for foundation; cured bricks for walls! 
The tower points high, firmly braced 
in steady steps to stand storm and quake. 

Stand! Stand, a tower as we stare gleefully, 
heads raised to the sky.
