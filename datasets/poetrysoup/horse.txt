February

Stone cold 28 days
Locked in winter's frigid haze
Sleep and warmth all I desire
To hibernate while my minds a mire
Dream of some past summers day
When we would run in fields of hay
Try to forget that my heart is breaking
For this love that's gone wrong
And my loves been taken
Some taken by you this cold dark month
Your icy fingers like death on the hunt
Freezing not only the world as it seems
But also the internal hopes and dreams

It was then you came to me...

Sweet dreams break through the winter's ice
To touch my soul this cold dark night
A fair dream of you so bold and white
Your eyes reflecting golden light
Together once again we ride
Perfectly paired in effortless stride
Warm visions of what is to come
Remind me of what must be done
And dreams of you will come again
When I need you most my waiting friend
So as the morning's light draws nigh
And I begin to question why
I struggle not to say goodbye
But still... I wake up with a smile
