Old Lover's Moon



The lovers are transported into another time and place as they sit  
Here by the river,                                  "two ambient runes"  
Electing not to speak, they comfort one another.  No words are spoken;
 
Only the moonlight tongues the sea with her language so sleek.  She  
Laps onto the shore retrieves, then is no more; 
Down by the shore, they make there sandy bed and turn to love; 
 
Lovers on the brink of self discovery 
On the brink, of soul's recovery   
Veering towards passion's furnace     
Each kiss leaves a trace;  
Rejuvenating by an abundance of water 
Souls celebrate the reunion of two hearts  

Moon glow, 
Open to us*
Open to us*   
Near us to you,            *bring us your light* 

The End.
