Child's Eyes

Ah, If all eyes were like a child’s.
Maybe then a balloon could lift us to the sky.
Life wouldn’t seem like a trial,
Broken hearts would begin to fly.
Harmony would be multiplied, 
Our minds wide and bright eyed,
Curiosity being our guide.
And humanity would be reconciled,
If all eyes were like a child’s.
