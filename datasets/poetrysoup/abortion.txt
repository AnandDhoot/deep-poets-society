Rest In Peace Innocent Child

She was such a tiny miracle of innocence,
taken from the womb by selfish greed-
Mommy just wouldn’t save her essence,
before the decision, it was already agreed.

A sweet baby from the Lord was gone,
why couldn’t she just choose adoption?
In her heart she knew it was wrong,
but her mother said it wasn’t an option.

Alas, pure child may you rest in peace,
an angel you are now with baby wings-
And to think I could’ve had a lovely niece…
Oh, what sorrow selfish desire brings.
