In life we need the simplest things

often we want everything

In so doing we get nothing

In the process losing everything

 

In times when we want the necessary things

Times when we have nothing 

In lines we wait for something

We will take anything

Because we stand for Nothing

 

Don’t be fooled by the smile i give (you see)

The lies i breed (you need)

Look between my eyes (to feel)

Read between my lips (in order to find the truth)

In the end (look deep within)

The fights i seem to win (don’t be deceived)

Are battles I fight ceaselessly

 

Before i leave 

I give you these…words

Words void of anything false

Personal wars fought

Thoughts of things lost

Rights which at time seemed wrong

 

Let these words fan a flame in you

Loose the chains you use

Ignite a spark in you

To live a fulfilled life

One which you choose

 

Sometimes

you win

Sometimes you loose

I lived my life like a fool

And there is nothing left or have to prove

There is nothing in this life for me

There is nothing I have any more to give

So…

I leave my very profound thoughts with you

Hoping that they move something in you

 

Often at times we look inside

Were the questions lie deep begin to rise

With fear we bury them with lies

Lies we tell ourselves that everything will be fine

 

Here is my advice to you

Don't let anyone bring you down

Wake up

And wipe away that frown

Keep going till you've got the crown

When you reach the top take a look around

Beat your chest and say “now am the man”

“No one can stop me now”
