Shake That Boy


Hey, little boy
I can see you starting
to go the wrong way
Because you don't listen
to what your mama and daddy say

Hey, little boy
That ain't no way to talk
Doing all that cursing,
cussing your head off

I wish I could shake that boy
Shake him
Shake him
Shake him the right way
I wish I could shake that boy,
but the only thing I can do is pray

Hey, little boy
That ain't no way to act
Talking back to grownups,
talking all that smack

Hey, little boy
You gonna turn out bad
Because you always fighting
every time you get mad

I wish I could shake that boy
Shake him
Shake him
Shake him the right way
I wish I could shake that boy,
but the best thing I can do is pray
