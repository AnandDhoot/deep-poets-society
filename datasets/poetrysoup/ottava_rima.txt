GREATEST FEAR




To ride the sea is a blessing and a curse
huddle of fleeting gulls dart from nowhere
lending frolic to breakers, they traverse
in mystic laps with hued bubbles so rare.
Toes swivel a distance and I immerse
from ripples of causeway, beyond compare;
Yet once, twice bold torrent did choke my lungs
Sinking into deep foam, into waves’ tongues.

I awake on bed of grass by the shore,
and from a hazy terrain, chirps enthrall
ridding my anxious glides of waters' roar...
but the fear-thrill of cruising makes me stall
as the bash of rapids pounds on heart’s core;
O dread, dread of drowning grips my breaths whole.  
And though tingle of far crests still delights
I’d rather stroll on coastlines without fright.
