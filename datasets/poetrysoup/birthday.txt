What's in a Day

This day for you is just a special day
A time to celebrate with closest friends
My girl, I’ll try to find the words to say
That on this day my happiness depends

For on this day, in love you came to be
My heart and soul I birthed into your form
With your first breath life’s meaning came to me:
A mother’s life your love had come to warm

How can you know the blessing that you are?
How can I make you see my depth of love?
My universe will pale without your star
On darkest nights it guides me from above

You are the dearest dream that has come true
You are my hope for better things to come
My joy of living life, your birth made new
You smile gives strength to live and not succumb

Your heart is tender sweet and ever dear
Your voice, it thrills the heart with tones of grace
The room comes all aglow when you are near
Your presence makes a home of any place

God blessed our lives on this most special day:
He gifted us a girl most precious, sweet
One day you’ll have a child, for this I pray
that as you've been, she’ll be love’s greatest treat!
