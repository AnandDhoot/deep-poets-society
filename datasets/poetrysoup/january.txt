A Fairy Tale

This skinny lonely wolf reduced to eating worms
Expulsed from his arguing with the leader wolf how best
To catch caribous
Nose to the ground it found an open chest of fifty 
Gold ducats and since they shone so bright he ate them all
And heavy was its belly 
When other wolf saw his stomach they thought he was 
A successful hunter and he taught them how to kill 
Caribous and deer too.  
As a leader dog, he was the first to eat from a kill and
Left behind a coin or as they a ducat and a hunter stalked him 
To find in his excrete another coin
Fifty times the hunter dug into wolf shift and came up rich 
And trekked home but a blizzard came, his was ill prepared 
This heavyweight he dragged about
Put the ducats under a tree and tire he came home 
When the weather cleared, he found the tree the coins were gone
And a boney wolf was walking away it had a huge stomach.
