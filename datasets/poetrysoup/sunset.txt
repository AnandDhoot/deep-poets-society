Wistful Sunset Surrender

Violaceous twilights, 
      clandestinely sated 
lavished 'til morn's early blush
     midst honey suckled euphoria,
 poetry hidden 'neath 
         silken pillowcases,
written 'tween the dew 
    of rendezvous' 
       blissed arousal
evermore eagerly breathless,
      reawakening intentions
  aloft the vast obscurity of
     a wistfully surrendered sunset
