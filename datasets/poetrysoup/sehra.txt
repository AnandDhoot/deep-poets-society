                          Kaleidoscope of Butterflies

~Tenors, base, all creating an seemingly endless hum… from beginning through  songs duration……Tenors and base humming… in background sounding on and off, … in background… 


                           Universe, space, stratosphere
                                ATMOSPHERE, Earth’
                            Joins two souls together

 
 ( Chorus, repeat 3x,s)  

…..A likened to butterflies through a kalei’do’scope, we come together…..freely choosing to bond alike butterflies resting in moonlit fields, we come together…

                         Forest green, reddest-red, 
                          Blue-citron silken veils 
            Brightly adorned faces, non-so lovely as bride, Le fem’


(Chorus)


                              Alike a rainbow
                 Colors expressing a Universal Atmosphere
              Vibing radiantly, spilling-over, covering Earth
           FULL of light and happiness at the resonance of vows

( Chorus, final)
