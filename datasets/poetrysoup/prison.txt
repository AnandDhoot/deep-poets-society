Running

With beating hearts
the young lovers run down the street
afraid of looking back
hearing only their shoes on the concrete.

Running into the night,
following the North Star
and the moonlight as guides
hoping to make it far.

"My feet are tired. When can we stop?"
"Dawn is coming. The sun will soon rise."
Dogs bay behind them.
This fear is lover's prize.

Before all is lost,
they race against time. 
Running into the woods
before morning bells chime.

"Faster," he says,
and pulls her along.
She feels his hand around hers,
sure and strong.

The lovers run and run 
not stopping till daylight.
Escaping imprisonment
running into the night.
