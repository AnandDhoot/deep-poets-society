Resignation Seems Unavoidable


She gives a sigh of resignation,
For her pain only seems 
To grow worse. Tears are unavoidable.

Her decision is unavoidable.
She smiles in resignation,
Or so it seems.

Her whole life seems 
To be controlled by the unavoidable.
That's why she hands in her resignation.

To the world, her resignation seems unavoidable.
