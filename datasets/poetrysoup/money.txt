A Tale Of Two Sons

A Tale Of Two Sons

There once lived a young man, his wife, daughter, and two sons.
One year, Christmas along with the money, had come and gone.
It was now the first work day after the Christmas holiday.

Early that morning, the father discovered that he did not have
sufficient funds for his work day.  He was forced to turn his attention to his two sons who were still fast asleep.

So he awakened his older son who was fifteen and asked if he had any money. The older son replied, “Yes dad, but not on me; I have to look for the money I have”.  The dad did not have time for the son to go gold digging.

The dad then turned to the upper bunk of his younger son who was eleven, asking him the same question.  In spite of being awakened from a deep sleep, replying immediately, his son said, “Yes dad.  Take my book from the table and turn to page 65.”  The dad, with a surprising smile, looked toward his older son who was struck with the same emotions.   They were both rather amused.   The dad took the book, turned to page 65, and found sufficient funds to take him through the day.

Although Christmas had taken its toll on the family budget, the dad was amazed and delighted over his younger son’s ‘book report’.  In addition, he had learned a treasured lesson about his sons.  Also, he had pleasantly discovered that words are not the only items of value to be found between the pages of a book.
