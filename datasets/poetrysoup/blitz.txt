She's acting really wierd now-a-days

She's acting really wierd now-a-days. 
Now that there's a new man , everything is just upside down.
She's acting silly and nice , now that he's around by her side.

Hugs and kisses like it's valentines day.
Look deeply in each other's eyes , a shooting star passing by.
Traveling town to town like a business making money.

Eventually making phones calls, pretty laugh and gingling twice:
Long hour talk from day to night.
Fancy dress up with make-up everywhere.

Cooking delicious food and taste the flavour of it's goodness.
Making little bet's like choosing side for basketball.
Holding hands tightly together and cuddle each other before saying goodnight.

Going to beaches , watching the sun slowly set in the east.
Taking pictures while memories are making...

I'm telling you, "Love is in the air" , and who can change that ?
