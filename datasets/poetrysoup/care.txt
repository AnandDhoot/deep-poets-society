Don't resist

I feel the love you want to give, see everything you are
And I want to take all your pain from you
Can you please let me take it, as I stand here from a far?
I wouldn’t want it another way

Knowing you more everyday
You are still so weak
Knowing you’re fragile in every way
I just want to take it all your pain from you

Oh, I think so many times
It’s what you do, and not what you say
Oh, it gives me hope you won’t resist
I know you need more of me, you need me more
Come as you’ve been, you are a gift
Please don’t go, don’t leave and don’t drift
But you seem to create this rift
Oh, I would take it all, please stay and don’t resist

I see you hide your secrets away
And you don’t know I see them so clearly
I’m standing beside you, all I do is pray
Saying this is what you need

Oh, I think so many times
It’s what you do, and not what you say
Oh, it gives me hope you won’t resist
I know you need more of me, you need me more
Come as you’ve been, you are a gift
Please don’t go, don’t leave and don’t drift
But you seem to create this rift
Oh, I would take it all, please stay and don’t resist

You’re craving my kind, so sincere
Because we’re the ones that care, we’ll never interfere
And all you want is to be held, close and secure
So let me take in in my arms, in a way so pure

Oh, I think so many times
It’s what you do, and not what you say
Oh, it gives me hope you won’t resist
I know you need more of me, you need me more
Come as you’ve been, you are a gift
Please don’t go, don’t leave and don’t drift
But you seem to create this rift
Oh, I would take it all, please stay and don’t resist
No… don’t resist
