Resignation


Realization came early in my life
Even allurements could not stop me to decide
Surrendering values in return of money, has no meaning
I resigned and resigned myself to walking alone
Gust of hopes brought spring to my life
Neighbours asked, “Has he gone mad?”
And my father said, “He chose freedom, instead”
Time – travelled ticking and came success after failures
It was not easy – living in a jungle as a loner
Over the years, learnt the skill with many cuts and scratches
Now, my friends who gave up – ask for light; replication starts
