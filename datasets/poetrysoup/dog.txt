Man's Best Friend

They are the defenders
 of our peaceful homes.
Sniffing out any trouble
 like fine toothed combs.

Serving military or civilians,
 they make us proud.
So listen to their warning
 when they bark aloud.

The loyalty and love
 they constantly do show.
If returned, this bond
 will continue to grow.

As canine or dog, they
 are great to the end.
They enjoy life as
 man's best friend.
