Learning the ABC


Apple
has such a beautiful red skin
Blood of the grape
comes from the fruit on the Vine I'm loving
Cedar
this rich red wood is truly good for building

Jesus Christ the Messiah
He's the apple of God's eye
The Branch shed His blood on the cross,
for our sins He had to die
His body is the holy temple which was raised again,
where all your transgressions are covered once you walk in

Anyway you ABC it,
we're covered by the blood of Jesus Christ
How can you not but believe this
Get cleansed with it, and obtain everlasting life
