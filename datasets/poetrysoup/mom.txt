Mom, in the Electronic Age

She's ninety-one, she doesn't get
electronic things and such.
She can mess up any device
with just a look or touch.

Yes, things change as years go by
but Mom's not one of those.
We steer her clear of newish things.
That's just the way it goes.

We gave up trying to log her on
to the computer at my house.
A battle of wills, it did ensue
between Mom and the computer mouse.

It was a war she could not win.
Frustration was the name of the day.
The cell phone was our next attempt,
which also failed in a very big way.

Remote control buttons are covered up.
Only the bare minimum can be seen
because when she starts pushing them all
her language becomes obscene.

So, its a basic T.V. and phone for her.
She really doesn't care too much.
She's ninety-one and doesn't get
electronic things and such.
