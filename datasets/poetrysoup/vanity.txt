I am woman

I am comical with the nature of being fickle
I am delicate and dainty, my spine sometimes jells
My bravado wobbles and wibbles
Life being me sometimes tickle

I have the strength, depth and vitality of a w-o-m-a-n
Sometimes I am frail under a love spell
Still I am mightier than a locomotive
More fierce than a raging bull 
Yet, I am sweet as sugar and dignified beautiful

Emphasis on the ferociousness of my being
That dead stills your heart and expedites your breathing
I am a sea shell ashore with great meaning

I am vulnerable and vernacular
Versatile and spectacular
Peace is my avatar
I am woman

My swagger thrust me to soar
My magnificence out pours
I am w-o-m-a-n
Hear me roar
