ALONE

I’ve known and loved being alone
solitary in the woods
startling the birds, trees, wasps and vice versa
the creeping fear of gloomy
mistook loneliness
solo night fishing
happy with stars, canoe, and hill silhouettes
large splash nearby smashed my calm
seemed like loneliness
then one day we sat in a crowded café
we two cozy amongst strangers chatting by
you got up and walked out leaving me knowing
deep true loneliness
when I started college father simply said
learn to be alone
might as well have said
never fall in love
