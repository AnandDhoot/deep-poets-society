Try To Hear the Real Truth

Truth,
hides in
many forms.
In stories told,
pumped up with drama.
Public opinion bent,
with journalism changing,
into a distorted sideshow.
Just give us the truth and you will see,
we have a mind, we know how to think.

When you listen to the news on TV
can you really believe what they say?
First they grab with a headline,
then inflate with their views.
Keep an open mind,
wade thru the fluff.
Try to hear
the real
Truth!
