Magnificent Mother

She was a wonderful woman and I thought the world of her.
Until I was forty-one years old, I had a magnificent mother.
Before she died, she was honest, special and unique.
While she was on her deathbed, my life became bleak.
Back in 2013, my brother paid me a visit in February.
He said that Mom would probably die and it was scary.
I was very lucky to have Mom and so was my brother.
When we lost her, we both lost a magnificent mother.
