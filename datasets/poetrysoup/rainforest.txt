The Magical Land

The Magical Land

I dream of mystical lands
High in the ancient trees
Hidden deep in the rainforests
A land where grasses grow uncut
Where birds of only the brightest colors
Sing the melodies for only heavens to hear
Where nymphs, fairies and sprites live
Dancing in the light of the setting sun
To a song that only they can hear
Magic dust covers the leaves
Shining like a far away galaxy
Such a special place to see
Still, man has no idea such a place exists
So, for the moment it is safe
And magic still exists in the world
At least for now
