I Can't Move On

You changed my life more than you’ll ever know,
Consuming my thoughts wherever I go.

My world is different and yet somehow the same,
Struggling to survive each time I hear or see your name.

This wasn’t supposed to happen, not to us,
My heart, soul, and mind refusing to adjust.

No one can tell me the reason that you are gone,
Just wants me to stay silent and keep moving on.

There was no choice given on being able to have you stay,
I didn’t even get to tell you everything I have ever wanted to say.

I failed my job as your mother, of protecting you,
And blame myself for what we now go through.

They say you’re in heaven and that you watch over me,
You will see him again just wait and see.

That doesn’t make it easier, the pain of being apart, 
But every night I cry and wish with all my heart…..

To just once more see your face 
To give you one more embrace

To see the tears and hear your first cry
To never have had to say goodbye.
