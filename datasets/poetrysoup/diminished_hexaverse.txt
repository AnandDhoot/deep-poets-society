DIMINISHED HEXAVERSE

Dramatic Monologue
Like writing your own blog
Stage actor’s solo hog.
Within Dramatic Verse,
a Didactic asperse,
I’d rather not rehearse!	

Diamantes are fine
It’s just that I find
In brain’s foggy mind
Speech parts in a bind
High school I rewind!

Double dactyl’s
darned hard, and will
headache instill!
Dodoitsu grills!

With Dizain
Much less pain
Sonnets slain

Shorter
Better

Verse!
