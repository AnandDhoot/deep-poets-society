Listen and Understand


Something very wrong is a-brewing
Something sinister,
something evil
And it ain't no robot from the future
that you need to be worried about
No, there are forces at work
that want to take us back,
way back to being straight medieval

Listen and understand,
everyone who wants to live
Don't let them con or seduce you
They want to take you back to a time
where brutality ruled,
and cruelty was the instrument used

A conspiracy very strong is accruing
Something abominable,
something evil
Gather all of your spiritual weapons
and hope it's not too late to terminate
all of those forces at work
that want to take us back,
way back to being pure medieval

They want to take us back to a time
where brutality ruled,
and cruelty was the coin of the land
It's imperative, I insist,
everyone who wants to live
must listen and they must understand
