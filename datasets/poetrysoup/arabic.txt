The Rising Sun 
There was a place in Curacao not far from
the town of Willemstad you could stay there till dawn 
when the whores had gone to sleep and the pigs in 
the ditch full of human detritus didn`t grunt. 
When the beer was drunk enjoy the cooling moment
of time well spent take a taxi out back to the ship look 
back and remember: Campo Alegre (the happy camp)
