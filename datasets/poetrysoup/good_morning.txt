a peaceful day

A peaceful day  
This day was a non-event woke up at nine had a coffee, 
a shower and then on the training bike for an hour
The sun was shining as we had breakfast of boiled eggs
nothing could upset me my wife had been dreaming
of a broken mirror, my dream was we had gone to Italy, 
Venice I think lots of water in smelly canals. 
We were eating at the local restaurant it is clean and we 
know the staff tipping them would be an insult.
When the place was empty, I got up grabbed a knife and
 killed my wife several times because I didnâ€™t want to go 
to Italy and no one had ever asked me what I wanted.
The police were kind and understanding let me drive home
 by myself.  At home, my wife had bandaged feet she had 
stepped on shared of glass from the broken window which
shows dreams sometimes come true
