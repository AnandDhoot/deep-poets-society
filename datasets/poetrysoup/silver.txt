Multicoloured Footwear

Multicoloured Footwear

A pair that are yellow
For when I'm feeling mellow
Shoes that are grey
For when I'm dismayed
I wear the beige
On quiet days
When I feel attacked
Then my shoes will be black
Orange is for times
I need to read between the lines
When my shoes are white
I'm being my most polite
My pink ones are worn
When my red ones are torn
When I where my purple ones
It's the time the day is done
My turquoise shoes 
I wear when confused
The shoes that are green 
Are for the same old routine
My red shoes I wear for
Solemn affairs
Silver shoes, of course
Are for when I need support
I always my blues shoes
Are worn when there's good news
I prefer most the flesh ones
There what I wear when I have none !
