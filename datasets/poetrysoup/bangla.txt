Standing On Balls

To think the planet circles round
while standing firmly as it falls.
Knowing all this time we've claimed our way
we're standing on balls.

From standing on balls that circle
to standing on balls that spin.
We're standing on balls of purple
and standing where balls have been.

We're landing on balls of moonshine
to landing where comets have hit.
Belonging where life comes to circle
and living where one comes to sit.

Large balls coming at us as quickly
as balls coming at us must swish.
In hopes that our balls will keep missing
while each of us carry's that wish.

Roll on with the wind of a pinball
and come on the ride of your life.
Where man holds on tight by his toenails
and travels along with his wife.
