Waiting is lonely



I see you there 
Looking so bare 
And so lovely 
I want to hold you 
And caress you 
Heal the broken parts of you 
We all have a few 
Or at least Mead your pain 
Take it away 
I want to kiss you 
Something I don't normally do 
But I want to show you I need you 
People always judge me to soon 
He's mean and cold ignore that fool 
But really I love a lot 
To much in fact 
I have pain you couldn't believe inside me 
You don't know my life story 
And if you did you would be crying 
Ive brought grown men to tears 
With my life stories 
The horrors the torture that was done to me 
90% of you would be dead if you lived even a quarter of my life 
So sorry if I'm not all nice all the time 
But I do feel something 
And im feeling you 
I wish you and I could meet 
Have a date and of course will eat 
I'll listen to you 
And you listen to me 
You and me always 50/50 
I love with intense passion 
Most can't handle it 
I'm ride to die 
As long as you need me for life 
The fire in your eyes 
It's got me curious 
Kinda delirious 
Your flooding my thought's and body 
I think your damn sexy 
And I wanna taste you 
All of you 
Whatever you want kissed I'll lick to 
I want you all around me 
Be like a cancer and never leave me 
Hold on to me please 
Grow old 
Die with me 
Really what are we missing ? 
Least for me nothing 
Everyone I loved has died or left me 
I'm empty 
But thinking of us I feel something
