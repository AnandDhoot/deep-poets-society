The Mother Gene

I could not feel the happiness
That a child brings to its mother
Or an urge to love and guide them
I will leave that for the others.

I could not feel the joy or pain
That comes from motherhood
My disease could have been passed on
So I stopped it where it stood.

Never the pain of childbirth was felt
Or the joy that might have been
For in Godâ€™s wisdom He made sure
I was not given the mother gene.

In exchange He gave to me
A loving heart for all mankind
For the wonders that cover the earth
Being childless I did not mind.
