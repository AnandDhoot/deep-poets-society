Forever and a Day

Forever and a Day

While the stars give light
And the moon is bright,
My heart will belong to you,
Stuck like superglue.
I'll love you forever and a day,
Until the 32nd of May.

While the sun shines warm
And there's no alarm
I'll look at our pictures and cry,
Thinking of the past wirh a sigh.
I'll remember you forever and a day,
Until the 32nd of May.

While the river flows fast
And shadows are cast,
I'll remember your warm smile
And your amazing style.
I'll miss you forever and a day,
Until the 32nd of May.

While the stars give light
And the moon is bright,
My heart will belong to you,
Stuck like superglue.
I'll love you forever and a day,
Until the 32nd of May.
