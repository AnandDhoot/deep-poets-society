The Poet


                                                  for Anna Akhmatova

This is easy living
Waiting for the Muse to arrive
whispering sweet lullabies
into my plume

You may get a bout
of insomnia, or
wake up before sunrise, or
stay up into

the wee hours
of the night
But it's all part
of the scenario,

the mysterious existence
that transforms the mundane
into kaleidoscopic dreams,
magnificent realities

consolidated onto parchment
or logged into your laptop,
into the realm
of earthly concrete.
