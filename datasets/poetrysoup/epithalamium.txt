A Rose Garden


For the Bride and Groom:
Love's declared amongst blooming roses
in a clearing of whispering trees, 
graciously holding their applause -
where romance grows in glorious blooms
of delicate pinks and vivacious reds, 
and souls come together, vows quench
the petals with eternal joy and devotion. 
As God, family and friends witness 
this budding union, may the roses sway 
always on a gentle breeze, opening the hearts 
of man and wife as they wed, welcoming
a new blossoming future. And if the roses 
ever wither from neglect or thirst, 
may husband and wife draw strength 
from the memory of this spring day, 
tending to their rose garden with abiding love, 
letting no thorns discourage and no man separate 
what God has joined under Heaven.
