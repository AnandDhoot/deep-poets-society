911 15th aniversary

Fifteen years have passed 
Since that fatal day
When terrorists killed 343
This is what it means to me

The people going about there day
Passengers flying on there way
Evil men take over the plane
Fly into the building thats insane

The losing of all those innocent
No way they can repent 
I know it was done for their cause
But all its done is create wars

From this major catastrophe
Many people just don't see
people have suffered from nightmares and theÂ  loss of life
Terrorist should be locked up for causing all this strife

My heart goes out too those that lost
Family and their friends
And wish that this event could be labeled the means towards the end 

They will not be forgotten 
As it changed the world that day
Everyone feeling rotten
Hands in my head I pray

I am not a religious man 
One thing I must just say
Look Mr terrorist take it
And please go away

The world does not need this trouble
It's been going on too long
To many people hurt in the rubble
Forget your radicalisation and move along 

Rest in peace everyone
Affected by the act
Let's hope the leaders of the world
Can sit and make a pact
