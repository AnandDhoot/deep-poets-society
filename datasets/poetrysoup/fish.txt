Fishy Blues

Smoke swims by like gilded fish rushing to make it to school 
before they are caught dangling from a force
intended to wrench their souls to arid climates and burning winds
With every breath, I feel my throat burn like gills
that beg for just one more ounce of water to slip through
while they wait to be taken home,
gutted, cleaned, fried, and served
to a family too burned out on an American dream
that will never come true

Born
Fished
Fried
Dead

Melancholy was 
born in my heart because I never
fished for the thing that makes it possible to feel happiness and the tubes that connect coping with progress are so
fried now that they no longer function and the trugh in this world makes the air I breathe feel
dead
