Raindrops



I'm raindrops away from the sun's orange pop.
You wonder where I stead.
I'm either up or down ,
And neither steam nor ice, 
I'm simply on my own,
although I run with thunder
and command seeds to grow.
I dangle in the wind, hook in the clouds
And anchor in the earth.
I bring clarity to opacity ,
Like this stagnant pool mirror overlaying the earth.
This little drop of yesterday
 can amount to an ocean.
