Three for the Mohammedan



The Kneeling Satan
________________

Satan you are nothing
without mans assistance.

Finally genuflecting to Adam
it realizes. 



Mohammedan Faces the Megalith
_____________________________

The choice of the free market:
bail it out,
this inherent corruption, 
as it dies
has it not 'spoke'?

Mohammedan questions why the megalith is needed when it is an enigma to those of it...

Every Mohammedan is positive,
positive
Allah will see it through.

Let the great satan intoxicate without license--
drinking in moderation--
knowing you wont make it:

Excess consumerism
to save -- preserve. 

Contemplate the self-critique limited in your responsibility, 
as if saying: come satan consume me
...let me consume you.


Enjoying Liberty with Ha-Shem
___________________________

Liberty, 
Ha-Shem.
The Jew can never taste it,
but the goyim;
at least those of ethical-monotheism 
will have it with you
Ha-Shem.
