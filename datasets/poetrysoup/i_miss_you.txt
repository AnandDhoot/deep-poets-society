Break

I sat there staring at the screen, dimly lit.
I read the words you sent and started feeling sick.
I was doubling over in pain and disgust,
And looking up at the sky to the lightning bolts and wind gusts.
And the storm clouds rolled in.
And the clouds stormed in rolls,
And the thunder ended my life,
and my life said what needed to be told.
That theres nothing you can do to stop it,
Or lower the stakes.
Because a hearts capacity to love can be measured by its capacity to break.
And its capacity to hate,
And capacity is all it takes,
But capacity isn't all that great,
Because capacity is fake.
I mean capacity increases in a liquid state.
And even more with a gas,
Having limited room for unlimited mass,
And no space in all the world for your unlimited ass,
Because in all the whole human race,
There was only one eye that caught my face,
and without a trace of regret,
you walked that 10 pace,
and turned around and robbed me blind,
Put your foot, around my sound, and started to mercilessly grind,
although in sight-hind,
hind-sight,
I lost my will to scratch and bite.
You touched my face and fight or flight,
And I might just might,
Forget the light,
that permeated my skin on that rainy night.
You laughed with joy as the rain fell down,
And you had a smile like a jewel on a crown.
And it was that moment forward that I knew,
I would do,
Anything to make sure harm would never come to you.
You taught me a lot,
And you taught me a little.
And you taught me me that it's not enough to be brittle.
You have to let go, of yourself, and of the world,
And sometime, you just have to let go of the perfect girl.
