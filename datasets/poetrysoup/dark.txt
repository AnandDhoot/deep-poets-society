within his eyes

His dark lips always enlighten my senses, although his white eyes profess a dark ambiance.
His  deed when done, stiffens the chisels of his arms to cross my waist 
and hold me into his heart 
I loom over within his eyes as a midget stretching for the truth.
Do you really love me? , or I'm I a niccumpup , with no colour to reflect?
