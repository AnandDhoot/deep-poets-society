you
dear
should be
confident
with your chaste beauty
not tell a suitor it's phooey
you simply have an air around you that's amazing
allure presents it's finest hour
purely unrivaled
confirm that
would you
girl
                        please?


It 
does
bother
one's psyche
when you won't concur
when one tries to convey to you
your exquisiteness being unparalleled by most
what could one do to prove to you
if one not attached
one could race
to be
with 
you
