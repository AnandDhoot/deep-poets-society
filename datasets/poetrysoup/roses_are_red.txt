Her Reddest Rose


If I were a rose, I would be the reddest one, 
The reddest one under the sun in her garden.

   I would repose under the frosty snows,
   The frosty snows that once froze, 
   F~R~O~Z~E me red so I won't decompose.
             I would bloom above the carefully groomed, 
             Groomed little place entombed, 
             Entombed with woes that consumed,
             Consumed her garden well perfumed.
   If I were a rose, I would propose, 
   Propose to her who bestows, 
   Bestows on me such crimson glows.

I would remain till my job would be done, 
Done as her reddest rose, forever f r o z e n.
