Sandbox

MaySea Mae loves to play play play. 

She has an imaginary friend named JaySea Jae. 

They laugh and talk all day in their tractor tire sandbox. 

In the blistering sun they bury treasure with their bare hands and draw maps with chalk on the sidewalk. 

At night they make believe; pretending to be on a real beach; talking about many moons. 

A caricature building experience colored in bright reds, purples and blues. 
Animated like real life cartoons. 

After a good day of rain, they make castles out of sand.

Using a shovel and a bucket, MaySea Mae plays drums in JaySea Jae's ultra famous big hit, fun band. 

Ma' and Pa' join in on the action and dance as their number one biggest, best fans. 

And they walk off into the sunset holding each others hands.
