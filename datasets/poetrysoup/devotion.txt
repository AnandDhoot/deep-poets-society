You blew it

You blew it, you threw it all away
You blew it, what do you want me to say?

You want me to blame her?
She was not at fault

You blew it
You tried to impress your mates
You blew it
One minute is all it takes

Be more than what you think you are?
Be more...be a superstar!
Couldn't handle her beautiful smile
Hid your ring, your promise, your devotion, your wife! 
How can that ever be worthwhile?

You blew it, 
You've got yourself to blame
You blew it
She'll never trust you again

Blame her, the booze, the feeling of the night
But really you could not put up a fight!
A inner fight for your wife?
You fool. You weak, pathetic sh#te!

You couldn't see that it would hurt your wife???????

You blew it
Don't come here for sympathy
You blew it
It's your wife who deserves our loyalty

You blew it
