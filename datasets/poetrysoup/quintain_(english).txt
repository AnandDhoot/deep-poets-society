Horses


    A horse that runs wild and free
 Enjoys freedom with each stride
    No saddle on his withers be
 No grazing muzzle as a guide
    No headpiece on his poll abides

    His fetlock and his coronet feels the tickle of the grass
 His forelock ruffles in the breeze
   No horseshoe on his hoof amass
 With the wind he trots with ease
    His gaskin flexes to run at his decree

     His frog feels the soft earth as he stands
 his coat feels the soothing rain
  Unbridled by the bit's demand
 His neighs echo through the plains
   Upon these green fields he reigns

     His stifle and his hock aches once in awhile
 But a good gallop 'neath the dome
    of sky, brings him back in form and style
 No crupper on his croup as he roams
     For this horse calls freedom home.

 *The crupper is the strap that runs from the horse's dock, over the croup, to the saddle.
