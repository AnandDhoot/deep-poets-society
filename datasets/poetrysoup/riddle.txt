Postcards

Let me see…
Give this one a Gothic Border,
For my mood is one
Of secret gardens,
Gargoyles-
All internal wanderings…

And this one,
Of an island 
Somewhere,
A place only
Tropics know-
The sea
Its endless border,
The sky
A far away glow-
A sleepy little lagoon-
Here fairies
Flit, flutter to tell
Flickering tales
Us dream thieves 
Dream to sell…

And now
Above a mountain-
Clouds lightly darkly speak,
Of misty rings
Cumulus things
Where summit and base meet-
Talk of a missing middle,
The answer a
2 syllable word:
Always in a climbing riddle
No middle would be absurd.
