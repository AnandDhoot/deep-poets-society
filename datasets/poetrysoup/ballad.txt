Maybe there is a way

I wish there was a way 
A better way to divulge emotions 
As vividly as possible 
Like a blue sky in broad daylight 
So I can express how I feel
An leave no doubts in your heart 
Because my intentions are noble

It's not a mystery 
Scientist confirmed long ago 
That where the eyesight tire 
It turns misty blue 
My eyesight rest in your world 
Hence you turn my world misty blue 

The blue shirt you had on the day we met
Complements your natural look
And showcase your beauty 

Like sun rises in the belly of the day
Reflecting in blue sea waters 
O! The nature's beauty is so remarkable
God was in a happy mood when he made you
Your smile takes my breath away
Like a snow in the valleys of Drakensberg
Your teeth are so bright and flawless
 
Maybe there is a way
I can undress my heart naked
And be explicit about my heart inclination 

Maybe there is a way
To let you know how I feel
Without upsetting your feelings
Maybe there is a way
To say I love you
And avoid rejection
My path end with you
