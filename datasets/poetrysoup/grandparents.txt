Love Named Eternal

"Till Death Do Us Part" - long ago both of us said,
And never lied, since you're right by my death bed.
As always, I am letting out a laugh in the end,
While you are crying and holding my hand.

Throughout all our lifes, to you, I never lied,
And our Love, named Eternal, has never died.
Some people think that Love eventually fades,
But we proved them wrong through many decades.

The chorus starts singing my farewell song...
Don't worry, my dear, nothing is wrong.
Yes, we may be now in different worlds,
But my Love for you still eternally holds.
