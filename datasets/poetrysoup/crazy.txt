revelation's optical illusion

Quintessentially phantasmagoric,
  her cobalt skies' chimerical fancy
     whores itself out for poetry, 
sumptuously cached 'tween 
    a revelation's optical illusion
enchanting white knights 
     and seducing dragons alike,
her flimflam elusively lofty
 & difficult to evermore be captured
    amidst celestial spheres of rapture
