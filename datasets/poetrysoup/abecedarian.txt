The Game




I often think of the game of life
And just how wicked it all can be
We know that it’s often rife with strife
And often so much strife to see
There are many ways to play the game
And many different ways to be a winner
I’ve seen a man cheat to obtain fame
And one destroyed by this evil sinner
By a magic man practicing a flim-flam 
A trusting man is sure to be taken 
A credulous soul unaware of the scam
Will unknowingly be mistaken
So when it comes to making money quick
Or getting to the top with ease
Don’t rely on the short cut gimmick
Be on the up and up. Will you? Please?
