Penny
Poem
Lionel Derbyshire

Penny I remember
From mummy and daddy
Never I took for granted
Just bought candy
Was called beetle nut
And hard to crack
Filled my hunger tummy
Timmy said it was yummy
He had no money
Shared him a penny
And left for country
Found Tammy jingle bells
Got married and had plenty
Penny back in memory
Mummy and daddy loved me
When times were empty
Penny was not too many
With very little to share
Yet made Timmy very happy.
