Angel of Darkness

#Angel

The angel of darkness came near closely,
It grabbed my hand and said it would show me,
The way of the world and how to survive,
I was blind, so I took its' advice.

We took a trip, We took our time,
We flew, but not high, close enough to the earth,
Close enough to bring tears to my eyes,
Something so beautiful can contain so much pain.

We walked down Amsterdam Avenue,
How could I have not known that the world wasn’t anything new?
When you live in a small town, you think you're alone,
The earth has many people who feel the way you do.

We walked Venice Beach, I could barely breathe,
People struggle everywhere, It’s taken long to see,
Everything will be better in California,
That’s what I always thought.

I’ll get out of this small town someday,
But now I will forever know,
Nothing’s ever truly better,
No matter where you go.

So if the angel of darkness ever arrives at your doorstep,
Grasp it’s hand as tight as you can,
Because the Angel of Darkness is life
Beautiful yet painful. But forever a part of me.
