There Was No Wrong

I once was eight
standing in sand.
I remember,
winds vibrations
across my cheeks.
My eyes watered.

I had mother,
I had father.
They had love.
If only, they 
knew it was for 
that brief moment.

It was a point,
there was no wrong.
No wrong in him,
no wrong in her,
no wrong in me,
no wrong in sand.

I remember,
I once was eight.
There was no shame.
No wrong in me,
no wrong in him,
no wrong in her.

My eyes water,
remembering.
I once was eight.
No wrong in her,
no wrong in me,
no wrong in him.

I had father,
I had mother.
If only I
knew it was for
that brief moment,
I would stay eight.

I remember
when I was eight.
Love was in her,
love was in him,
love was in them,
there was no wrong.
