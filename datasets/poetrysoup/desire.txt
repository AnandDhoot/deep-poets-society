fight for you

The true beauty in a human nature
Build in a form of a lady.
Attracted to the demon in you
Your angelic being is song,
The lyrics i write to perform a you 
So pure it shine like snow.
The sadness in you smile
The cry in your laught
I am in love 
Trying not show but this feeling
Drives me like a drunk man
I am out of control.
I looks of your eyes light the way
To my words
I am speechless but my mind 
Is talking in tongues i cant understand myself.
I wrote you in the night
The owls sing of the death killed in the night
I am praying for your attention
Like begger for money.
I am hungry for your love 
And look like i am starving.
My flesh dies in a dream 
You are the main  character i chase after you
I am like the villian.
To see you happy is my mission.
You are my sweetness in this sour milk,
The warmth in the winter
My light in this night
My dream in the day.
I am happy to see you i am like puppy to its owner,
I need your affection 
my imagination ruins my concentration 
I need an auto focus
But you are the centre of my attraction 
You make me feel large in enormous world
Counting my blessing they are a number of the stars,
And Of the hair.
With all my blessings I have my problems
But you are my cure
A prayer that heals my curse
And antidote for my virus.
I wrote this for you 
Because you are you
And there is a few of you.
Now that I found you 
I am fighting to have you.
