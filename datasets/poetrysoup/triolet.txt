Autumn Leaves

Amber leaves waltzing with russet and gold,
whirling, twirling as they dance to the ground.
Timeless beauty of nature unfolds.
Amber leaves waltzing with russet and gold,
becoming a carpet of colors bold;
when walked upon make a crisp crunchy 
      sound.
Amber leaves waltzing with russet and gold,
whirling, twirling as they dance to the ground.
