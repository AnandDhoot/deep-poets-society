Racing To Arms

Racing to Arms

Two parallel scenes come to mind,
Each of a similar yet different kind.
Melanie sees Ashley in” Gone With the Wind,”
Hobbling home from the Civil War, over the glen.
She cannot run fast enough, into his arms.
He runs from his distance to feel her charms.

In the Depression Era, times were moribund,
Worse off for Black people like the Morgans.
Rebecca sees Nathan in the movie” Sounder,”
Hobbling home from prison camp to be around her.
She cannot run fast enough into his arms.
He runs from his distance to feel her charms.

In both scenes there’s urgency in their faces,
With arms opened wide to meet up with embraces.
Love is colorless, ageless, timeless and free.
What a thrill racing to long missed arms must be?
