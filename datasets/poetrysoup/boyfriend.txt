A guy

I am a guy,
I am also human
No supernature power
And i am immune to pain
You all might think she is the one hurt
but she is the one that hurts
fell for her
in front of a crowd
but she turned away 
like she never knew me
Yes i am a guy
And it hurts more 
Now that my pain is ignored
