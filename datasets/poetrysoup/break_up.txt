Time




 We lived in a broken clock for two years ,
Pressed against so many walls,
We questioned our time together
And each answer we gave
 swung like a pendulum bob between yes and nay
I told you of my inner fears,
Of a ticking sound in the air
You promised that it would be forever
But you went on to change batteries
So the hands of this time piece moved on 
And so did we
Boom!, the sound of an explosion
The end.
