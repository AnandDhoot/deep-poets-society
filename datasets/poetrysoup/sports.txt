Live to fight another day

We live to fight another day
for each we stand
without delay.
With arms locked tight 
we forge a bond,
In this battle
we make our mark.
We test our strength
we push and pull, 
just to know 
that we have the heart.
We imagine the best   
In those we share,
the greatest game,
the ultimate fight. 
It has been branded that
This day would come,
Where we shed our fears 
And unite as one. 
So as we stand 
and this we pray.
Letâ€™s live to fight another day.
