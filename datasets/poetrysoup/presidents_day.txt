Promises

When I hear the promises of man to man
And I know that they can and do fail.
I am thankful for a Holy God,
Who will prevail even over the gates of Hell.

Leaders come and go in this world.
They make promises they cannot keep.
But God is sovereign, He reigns over all
He will never fail usâ€¦we can safely sleep.

Presidents and Kings, Governors, and Princes
May plan great and wonderful things,
But only our God knows the future we face.
What this country needs is God, 
And the peace that He brings!
