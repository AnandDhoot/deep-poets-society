Day Life Began



Into the cathedral she came:
Veiled face
White lace

Looking at me:
Down aisle
I smile

My heart, in awe of what is to be:
Soars miles
She smiles

At the altar I stood and soon:
My bride
Beside

At the right time I:
Lift veil
See grail

She is a sight to behold:
Eyes gaze
Joy haze

With vows exchanged, our lives:
Entwine
Cloud nine

That day I had all I wanted and needed:
New life
With wife
