October Golden Chain

Percussion plays once in a while beyond its curtain
In duo with the flash of paparazzi’s capturing film
Prelude to an exhilaration of blissful days’ chain
Where rain and sunshine smack on a rainbow beam

In duo with the flash of paparazzi’s capturing film
Buoying up the breeze as it dances and toasts its grace
When rain and sunshine smack on a rainbow beam
Blissful days of October, in wide open arms…embrace

Buoying up the breeze as it dances, toasts its grace
Petal-litters bounce and float on air in tranquil glade
Blissful days of October, in wide open arms…embrace
As green grasses bud out from densely colored bed

Petal-litters bounce and float on air in tranquil glade
Prelude to an exhilaration of blissful days’ chain
As green grass buds out from densely colored bed
Percussion plays once in a while beyond its curtain
