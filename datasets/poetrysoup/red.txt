Maple Leaves Love

Donated all fragments of paragraph wrote on summer
Asked autumn to mark the red prints sent to the flapping wind

The wind was on a country road covered with red carpets
Picked up uncompleted dream that made by painstaking efforts

Who can decipher the red through out the hillsides?
was that passionate love? was that blazing affection?

Wind skimming the surface of reddish water like a dragonfly 
Careless to scatter those pieces of sincerity
