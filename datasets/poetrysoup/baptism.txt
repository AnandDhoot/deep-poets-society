Trudy left on a Friday night all she had she held to tight
Got on a bus and left that day, neighbors glad she went away

Arrived at the station in the middle of the night
The big lights of London looked so bright

Big city starry night wish mum could see me tonight
She felt like a princess of the night.

The bastard man that ruined her life
Had run away with her fathersâ€™ wife

To go back now would be a defeat
To stay hear have fun would be a real treat

 Hand in hand she went in tow
Where it was leading no one would know

The first hits free and it feels so fine
The second one costs and your addicted for time

Pimped and punched from pillar to post
And by the ones she loved the most

No men ever knew her name
But they paid there money all the same

Trudy died on a Friday night she had nothing to hold on tight.
