The Birth

The Birth

                   1
 Breathe baby—breathe.

Out of the darkness of night
crept the dawn;
steaming with thirst
the dry mouth sun rose
inebriating its self 
with the morning dew—
leaving empty blades of grass
scattered across the landscape.
		
3
The lazy old sea
urged on by quite winds
laboriously spat out
lethargic waves—whimpering  
tears of fickle frothed faces
repeatedly slapped at the shores.

		4
A lone sea gull sliced
through the salt laden air
leaving a pasty white trail—
an umbilical reminder—left 
behind the perilous journey’s end.

		 5
Laying in veranda hammock
of roped womb, I cracked a smile—
whispering to the Creator—singing 
praises for yet another birth of day.
