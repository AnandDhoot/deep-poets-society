Okay, just drop one in


Ok, Just drop one in
No one will see
It's not a major sin
As harmless as a flea
Quick, he's not paying attention 
Good, now just walk away
Nobody gives me detention,
Without having to pay 
I wonder how fast it will work
By the end of class I hope
He'll be sorry he was a jerk
And said I was a dope
I don't think he will keep us after class
He'll soon run out of facts to give
He will get out of here pretty fast
When he starts to feel that laxative
