Alone and broken

Lovely you are from a far my heart my love and my soul lingers on to you this poems I write mean heaven I can't show but I can write to express what actions and words can't believe I have tried but nothing works 
But you work right for my wounded soul when I leave 
And or when you let go I would not let go 
My love my heart lingers on this poem is all for you my love Mpenzi Mia amor 
Together we can build our own little world if you let us be my love Mia amor this poems are for the southing of your soul and heart
