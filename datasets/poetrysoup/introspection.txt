CHANGE MYSELF

I used to talk a lot.. yeah
Felt a need to say my peace
The problems to me so obvious
Why hold back, let go, release

All my words fell on deaf ears
Like pearls before the swine
My desire to change the world
Shifted and changed over time

These days I'm mostly quiet
My passions much contained
The world has grown darker
But it no longer drives me insane

Ambitions have been adjusted 
World change is on the shelf
Heaven on earth is now internal
So I only seek to change myself
