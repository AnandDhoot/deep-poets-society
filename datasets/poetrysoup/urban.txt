The city person's ballad:  urban versus rural

Let me into your living room
And let me dwell on your mist
And I will tell you a story
About city life versus rural life.

Now the city has been known to be a place of lights
But many have discovered many fights
And a violation of a list of human rights.

-For this is a place one has to fight very hard to be heard,
To be respected and to get ahead.

You will further be told about finding so much gold
Though one soon learns that they grow old 
Before you can that see it or at least that get hold.

-For one learns that when trying to find a job,
you will be tossed back and forth and cheated
Before you learn to stand up on your own.

The city is said to be a place of opportunity
Where one has to reach the possibility
To showcase their innate capability.

A place where you can reach for one's dream
But have to really always scream
To get hold of your cream.

-This is because while fighting to be heard and ahead,
 you have to compromise your sense of morality to get what you want.

Many get attracted to the city's glitz and glamour
But then one learns that you have to do a certain favour
In order to keep up this fervour.

-On the contrary on the streets you see more beggars
And hawkers begging for pennies.

Along the way things remain the same
You just need to keep up with the game
Of being humble and tame
In order to win the fame.

-Now, one soon learns that they actually
Yearn for the peace and realness
Of rural countryside life.
