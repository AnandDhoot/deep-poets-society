Please gently walk into the night

Please put the uneasiness and regret aside
Gently walk into the night
Let all the light illuminated to be written in moonlight
 
Even the beauty is still tangled, and the filthy is still around
Since the day has fade away, then let's put all them aside
Gently walk into the night
 
Everyone has to be brave to accept the truth
That life is a one-way trip, we are onboard, and outside the scenery,
No one could really own a memory, a witness,
 
So, let the seasons back to the day and tender to the night
Let's put aside all witnessed, the uneasiness, the sorry, and even the joy
Let's take not a bit of sorrow and regret
Gently walk into the night
