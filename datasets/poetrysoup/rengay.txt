Hydrangea blues
blooming in seven colors
versatile at heart
 
Storm clouds in a tantrum and yet
the rainbow
 
Gently wipes away a facade
reveals a layer
hidden within
 
Pretty just like yesterday
red-hot pokers
 
Playing fireworks 
on lovers' palates 
scintillating senses
 
The shared spaghetti noodle
growing shorter
 
Sunlight fading
into a sweet dream
aromatic  Osmanthus
 
'tween the slits of enclosed fingers
flashes of a firefly
 
Smolders of passion
unfolding within
Chrysanthemum  mysteries
 
Instead of the bee
her tender touch
 
Frozen fixture
all the yellow once in the field
now in the moon
 
Aesthetic display
of a crystallized Rose quartz
 
The snowy hills
at this time a strange warmth
morning blush
 
Purplish Crocuses
pop their cheerful heads up kisses blown
 
Thinking himself
to be King Arthur
startled butterflies
 
Surprised Tulips
opening lips with an exclamation
 
August heat!
there goes the evidence
of the snail
 
Spiraling down a Corkscrew vine
into a time portal



P.S. Haven't been on lately ... hope all is well with everyone :)
