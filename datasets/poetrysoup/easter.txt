Remember Me

Remember Me


Remember me
When I used to talk to you
About all my joys, fears, happiness, and tears?
I always found comfort on your knee.

Where did those times go?
Were they washed away with the rain?
Or dried up with the sun?
They aren't something to outgrow.

Remember me
When I knew you'd always catch me?
No matter how hard I fell
I knew you would never leave me.

I used to know
That I could trust you
That I always had a hand to hold
Where did those days go?

 I know itâ€™s of my own accord
That I feel this way
Life sometimes creeps up
And makes us loose things we can't afford.

Remember me
As I try to find you again
And get things back and even better
Than the used to be.
