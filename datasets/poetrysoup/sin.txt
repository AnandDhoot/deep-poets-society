When God Forgives, He Forgets

God is so glorious that when he forgives, he also forgets.
When he forgives a sin, committing that sin is something that we no longer have to fret. 
When God forgives, he forgets and he never again thinks about the sins that we commit.
We have to confess our sins to him and try to do better, our sins are what we must admit.
But to be forgiven, we must first forgive others, that's what we must do.
If we refuse to forgive, God won't forgive me and he won't forgive you.
