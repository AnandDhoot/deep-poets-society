Heart trapped between two mountains

When my heart is crushed between two rocks, 
I struggle to find you in the darkness.
Build of temptation
foundation of moral
a layer of guilt.
To lead me in this world of shit twisted hearts.
Take mine out to see if you were hiding you there.
Building on temptation
flowing though lust 
killing myself knowing all that I have lost.
To take my heart to free my soul because I always knew I would be buried alone.
