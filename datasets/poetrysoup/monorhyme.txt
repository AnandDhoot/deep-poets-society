Twilight - The Right Time



The time is just right.

It's neither dark nor bright,
Neither day nor night,
The sun has set alright;

In the last beams of light,
Birds take their final flight,
For a sweet night's respite;

What a beautiful sight!

God's wonders sure excite,
My mind does ignite,
Along with the street light;

Cosy in my corner with delight,
I sit to think and write
Some thoughts on twilight;

For the time is just right.
