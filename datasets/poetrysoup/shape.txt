FRIENDS
     RACE   suntanned   AROUND
SIX   granules imprinted with   FOOT
TRUCK     tiny hands and feet, never.   TIRE
   WE     still. shovels dig, trucks empty sand.   BOUNCE
FALL   the closest place to heaven outside   INTO
PLAYFUL the summer swimming pool       SAND
RUBBER we splash inside our sandbox WALLS
CONTAIN borders  CHILDRENâ€™S
     LAUGHTER
