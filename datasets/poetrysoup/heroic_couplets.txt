Gemma Prescott

The club event at the Paralympics, 
Is unique only to the Paralympics, 
And is for people with cerebral palsy, 
Or for the brain injured traumatically. 

It weighs 14oz and is 5 or 6cm in width,
It is made of wood and is quite a megalith. 
It’s end has a spherical ball for you to grab, 
To throw it, ‘cos that’s the aim, the slab. 

The club is an athletics field event, 
But Gemma previously did loudly tent, 
Discus and shot put, and in Beijing 2008,
She came 8th in discus, shot put 7th gate.

At the Deli 2010 Commonwealth Games,
She came third in the shot put’s frames,
But then changed to the club throw gaiters,
To claim bronze in it in London, 20.50m.

She comes from Truro town in Cornwall, 
And the BWAA help her workout, do call;
From Great Sankey High to St Andrews, 
She did go to gain in maths a Masters. 

She was born in September in the year ’83,
And has cerebral palsy just as I do, bree; 
I used to throw the club like her, at school, 
Out the back on the grass where I was cool.
