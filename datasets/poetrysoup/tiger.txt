TIGER

I was walking my tiger home
from our usual late night roam.
I prefer to go out at night.
Less around to get a fright.

As we strolled along
I hummed a happy song.
I then heard breaking glass.
Turned around in a flash.

You should have seen his face.
Jewellry robber with his case.
Dropped the diamond haul and ran.
Zoomed off in his stolen van.

I admit I was feeling smug.
Ringing the police to report that mug.
Adventure retold over the phone.
Now I'm walking my tiger home.
