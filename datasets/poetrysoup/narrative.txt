The Pipe Organ And Bach



The pipe organ hummed into life with the sound of Bach playing
toccata and Fugue in D minor. With mortar and pestle Mira crushed
the herbs and drank the amber liquid that swirled inside her goblet.
June espied the black moon as it swelled with silver pride.
She waited for the clock to strike 3, no canonical masses were being said at that time.
"One last ingredient I'll skeet, then children go ahead, eat and eat."
June cackled then returned to the table to light the black candlesticks.
"Mira come here" but Mira only gushed, "A few more tonics
June, and I'll be all fresh and rosy faced!"June gave her an
irked look, "My aren't we vain!"
They were two geysers living in a world of malcontent.
Over by the corner stood an old claw foot tub with broken remnants of what was once a beautiful dignified mirror.
It had been mutilated an eon ago by an enraged Mira, "ahumm" shall we say back when she was all rosy cheeked? yeh right.
Do you hear them? the candles, do you hear them? I would
recognize that tune anywhere. It's none else than Bach and his famous nocturnal music.
