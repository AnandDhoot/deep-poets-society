Why Am I Here

Spelunking inside her mind,
searching for the answer she cannot find.
She keeps looking, draped in fear
as she asks, why am I here? 
No one is guiding her path
she only exists as an aftermath
of two drifting, lost souls
who were unable to define their goals.

Two humans united on a withering night,
giving spark to a life without delight.
How could they in such despair
not be fully aware
that the seeds of poverty they sewed
would grow up to be predisposed
to a life of abject gloom
because their spirits contained not one bloom.

Growing up with a feeling of being alone,
keenly aware she didn't belong
in a community with a rare glimpse of grace
for a family seemingly out of place.
Streets lined with false facades
of people believing they were a favorite of God's.
A little child unable to discern and find her way
became the nasty people's prey.

After years on the battlefield of life,
she again feels the pain that cuts like a knife.
A divorced mother of two; one a father, the other gay,
they both live far, far away.
She bows her head to pray,
and ask why does it have to be this way.
Her heart is empty of cheer.
She softly whispers, why am I here?
