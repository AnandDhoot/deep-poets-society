A poem I read 48 times a year

Three hundred and sixty five days
I have to face them all
Some will be filled with grace
Others will be filled with hardship
To handle this I flip my mind and read
He that wants to lead a life
Worthy of purpose must read
The glory will then be seen
How human beings have the ability to
Make something out of nothing
‘They can turn weeds into gardens
Pain into triumph and sorrow into joy’

Never set your goals too low or
You may have to face one mean blow
If you don’t need much
Then you won’t become much
The time to clutch your hands will come
But for now stay in touch with reality and
Remember that human beings have the ability to
Turn nothing into something…
