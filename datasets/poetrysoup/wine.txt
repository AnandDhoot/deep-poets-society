Paris Floods

Paris Floods

In the city of young lovers
Of those lost philosophers
I rushed there to be
Alone
Walking along ancient stone

I was flooded
With wine
The rains would not stop
Depressions grasp soon to make me drop

Surrounded by poetry
Buried in the authors plume
Black ink crawls all over 
Devouring what little was left of me

Celts marched long ago
In footsteps I silently trace the sadness
The blood of angst fills me heart
I can no longer live inside those stories of lore

Rains keep falling
Rain pouring over me
Surrounded by books
I succumb to my death you know as
The Paris Floods

Drowned by poetry
