Forewarned

exodus'  plague  had forewarned
dire straits if the first was scorned
 
and first was the crimson tide  
nine more as pharoah defied
 
some millennia since passed  
we come to know how it's caused
 
on bondi's beach there was red  
algae teemed. massively spread  

sea sparkle speaks Moses' tongue  
mend ways or by plagues be stung

Australia's Bondi Beach saw the Sea turning red on 27 Nov 2012. Popularly referred to as Crimson Tide it is also called Sea Sparkle or Nocturnal Scintillans, this phenomenon is observed from time to time in various parts of the world and is attributed to a sudden rise in the red algae population due to rising temperatures in sea water and other favourable conditions.
