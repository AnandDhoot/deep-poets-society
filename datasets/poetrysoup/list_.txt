My Janky Car

My Janky Car
crowed parking lot,
cars going every which way,
a honk,
the window roll down,
screaming woman,
You need to get a....,
life, I thought she'd say, 
but, new car I heard her scream,
laughed oh so hard did I,
screaming woman now transformed,
confused and irritated woman,
laughing still I drive away,
If only that woman knew,
3 x's a day I'd say,
I need to get  a new car,
though meaning to offend,
we strongly agreed,
not the reaction she wanted from me,
I won,
Ha ha He he.
