Watching the Geese in Flight

In the blue sky of sunshine
There are white patches of clouds
Joining them is a flock of geese
Flying in a V formation,honking
As they pass by my house

How do they stay as one
Without bumping into each other
Flying evenly together
Without losing their rhythm?
It does fascinate me

As I watch them flying by
I notice their southern pass
To somewhere very warm
Water blue,grass is green
Spending their winter there

I go to the window and look to the sky
To watch all the action that is taking place
Until they have passed on their way
Then I go on with my work
Happy that I have seen their flight
