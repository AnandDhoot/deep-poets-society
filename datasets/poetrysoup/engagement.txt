Depth of the Darkness

Depth of the Darkness

Where I am
Unknown even to me
The dizziness
Dis-orientations linger here or
Maybe there

I am not quite sure
Other than I have drowned
Emptiness overcomes even
The sadness
Eyelids, do I have them?
Emptiness you see is a blindness
Seeping into the nether lands of my heart
No longer caring
Or daring
Hidden in the darkness
At all the staring


BANG
Thunder
Struck by a fantasy
Off I go, on the expressways of tears
Lights bright, then darkness
Darkness then bright lights

I am sitting now
In someone's Den, maybe mine?
Caressing, holding
Yet...............
There I am so silent
	Alive?
SMILING
I am smiling right into a smile
A smile stares back
Filled with a warmth
Never before felt
In this lifetime or the ones before
Seconds become minutes
Become hours
No words are spoken
There exists but a tenderness
Of thoughts
Passing from me to the smiling one
From her to me
Fear of breaking the spell
Is this the full accounting of it all?
Have the gods balanced the books?
Of all things I expose to her
The debits and credits
Why I have no idea
But she is smiling, always smiling
I see colors
Plump wonderful huggable colors
I never saw before

My oh such wonderful thoughts
Slowly, both so fearful
Memories entwined with pains shared
Outstretched arms reaching

Radiant, solar is her smile
Angelic in an earthly way
A smile of all things
Filled with a bouquet of love
In eyes that have voices

Skies so clear
Filling with clouds
Floating
There I am
Back into the night
Of eternal darkness
As I toss the key to all in the wind

Having been robbed of all emotions
In a haze of nothingness
There is still a little pain
And a seed of hope
As the soul rots a little more
Into the sands

Lacking passion
Is humanities only crime
