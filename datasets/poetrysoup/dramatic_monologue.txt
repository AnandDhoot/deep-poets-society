Masquerade

Colourful fanciful with myriads of mirage
Hidden in public glare
The more you look the less you see
Opened in hidden trenches
The more you dig the less you uncover


Clothed more in shades of grey
Preying on the public treasury
Fleecing the unassuming with
Alacrity akin to mediaeval thieves
Leaving the leaching wound


Letting the trickles cascade down
You masquerade it in soothing words
That is suit to the garbage trash
Giving rhetorics instead of economics
That will deliver from this doldrum


Time is of the essence for action
Every ticking tock of the time
Count and should be made to count
As these masquerading marauders
Needed a dose of reality
