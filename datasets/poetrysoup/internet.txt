SPONGES

Absorbing everything 
Cause I see everything
Searching behind hidden doors 
Combing through the shelves and drawers 
Where's the social validation  
Social media is like an infection 
Information pours like a continuous storm
Being nosy is now the norm
People now days only look at our flaws and imperfection
We live in a land of no freedom with injustices, no true love, and no deliberation
Floating distantly on edge of eternity
All of this violence is integrated into the minds of mortality
So many of us are living in fear
I’s a shame that we are soaking our hearts in each other's tears
Trust me those tears don't flow in vain  
We have A Redeemer, and A Savior…..Jesus is His name
