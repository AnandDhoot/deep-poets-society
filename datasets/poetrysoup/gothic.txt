Burn A Church

Kill her, won't you just kill her
You put a gag in her mouth and stabbed her
She's begging for you to kill her
She's smiling, she's begging for you to notice her

Burn a church and bury my body within the ashes
I'll let my holy spirit rise to heaven and heal my gashes
When I arrive at the gates of heaven may I pay with a thousand lashes
Send me back to hell with the rest of my family to gift them with slashes

Kill them, why can't I kill them
Fill their lungs with thick tar to suffocate them
Their begging for me to kill them
Take the knife and see itâ€™ s sharp touch into them
