Dark Matter

Dark Matter does exist
They said so on the radio today
It seems that scientists
Are working on another way to say

What we know anyway;
That stars determine, we are powerless
And gravity must have the final say
Form and substance fold away from sight

Entropy extinguishes the light
Perspective is diverted from itâ€™s course
The universe, no longer infinite
Is fragile as the filament that links us to the source

Out across the waters of the formless silent deep
A goddess dreams a lotus in the vacuum of her sleep
