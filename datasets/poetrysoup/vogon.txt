At the edges of synapse
The now of the being
Is a flame of thought
Some chemical dream
Drawing on physics
To divine understanding
A semblance of self
Formed slanted recantings
That are then broadcast
Through the spaces around
And remisinterpreted
By witness and crown
But the mind is quantum
And straddles the bounds
Of the 3rd and the 4th
In dimensional grounds
Itâ€™s best to not look
Or they will look back
These beings of light
Defined by the black
