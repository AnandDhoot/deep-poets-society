A Terrific Teacher

I am the custodian of brighter future
and the vanguard of a viable venture.
I take seekers on an alluring adventure.
Nature has given me the grace to nurture...
I am a terrific teacher.

I am the silent star that sleeps not at night,
the sun that make beautiful days bright...
I give sweet glow to the moon at twilight...
Lightening up the world is my greatest delight.
I am a terrific teacher.

I am always expected to do the miraculous:
students expect me to be gentle and generous...
rash parents sometimes tell me the ridiculous
yet my pay check makes nobody feel jealous.
I am a terrific teacher.

I inspire greatness and ignite creativity...
my words and thoughts instill integrity.
I see distinct ability in every disability
and spark the fire of academic alacrity. 
I am a terrific teacher. 

I preen with passion on priceless pages
to mend the minds where rot rages.
With love and life as my core languages...
I spur the spirit of compassionate sages.
I am a terrific teacher.

Beyond the grades scored in examinations...
beyond the goals of United Nations;
I provide real answers to unasked questions
and give hope to unborn generations.
I am a terrific teacher.
