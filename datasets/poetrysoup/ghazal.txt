Verse where love doth proclaim, neath nature’s ever-seeing gaze
Where words rhyme and refrain, neath nature’s ever-seeing gaze

Poets of Persian fame, for them is this joy’s acclaim
Their pens burned fiery flames, neath nature’s ever-seeing gaze

Like flowers’ dancing game, with the breeze and bees untamed
Tones of sweet honeyed names, neath nature’s ever-seeing gaze

To soar as birds their aim, and sing with hearts unashamed
And as one the souls came, neath nature’s ever-seeing gaze

Here, Woo, fills timeless frame, painting hues that feel the same
Finds peace holding no claim, neath nature’s ever-seeing gaze

UNDYING TWILIGHT (rewrite of caught in twilight using form's rhyme scheme)

Light faded some time ago, it has since been twilight
Half death stills in mute songs, of ever dark-green twilight

Where are those heated rays of a sun-bright, smiling face?
They have hung sunk, so long, hid in velveteen twilight

Some days the glow shines fiercer with passion’s orange gaze
But night then sends its prong; heat's pulled from chilled-scene twilight

The brilliant blues have dimmed; they linger in hazy mauve
Straining the eyes, bats throng; black winged to unseen twilight

In the murky tranquil tolls a bell of disquiet
Arrows of geese bang gongs; this is no pristine twilight

Woo walks, as ghost shadow caught in the cloistering dusk
beside the billabong, stale amaranthine twilight.

CAUGHT IN TWILIGHT (original write: didn't understand rhyming patterns)

Light faded some time ago, it has since been twilight
Half death stills in mute songs of never ending twilight

Where are those heated rays of a sun-bright, smiling face?
It has been sunk so long, embers gasping in twilight

Some days the glow shines fiercer with passion's orange gaze
But night then sends its prong, and pulls the heat from twilight

The brilliant blues have dimmed; they linger in hazy mauve
Straining the eyes as throngs, of bats, vanish thru twilight

In the murky tranquil tolls a bell of disquiet
Arrows of geese bang gongs and honk in the paused twilight

Woo walks, a ghost shadow caught in the cloistering dusk
like swag man's billabong, wishing way out of twilight.

LOVE AND MARRIAGE - Take 1

Two hearts in love unite, expecting loyalty
yet marriage vows intone, distrusting loyalty.

On paper is signed fidelity, love’s promise
Sealed as wife in ink, obligating loyalty.

Wedded allegiance pledged, in pen, then voiced aloud
Love’s public faithfulness, displaying loyalty.

Fealty in love compels a giving of self - less
legalese commands, to force trusting loyalty.

Love’s devotion and zeal, is easily defined
Turned to contract, becomes demanding loyalty.

You, she followed steadfastly, true to your love’s will
In harsh actions and words, betraying loyalty.

(Second time around - revised internal rhyme)

Two hearts in love, unite, expecting loyalty
yet marriage vows intone, distrusting loyalty.

On paper is signed fidelity, love’s promise
Sealed in ink-blue tone, obligating loyalty.

Wedded allegiance pledged, in pen, then voiced aloud
Love’s faith in public zone, displaying loyalty.

Fealty in love compels a giving of self - less
legalese which groans, to force trusting loyalty.

Love’s devotion and zeal is easily defined
Turned to creased loan, becomes demanding loyalty.

You, She, followed steadfastly, true to your love’s will
of harshness now atoned, betraying loyalty.
