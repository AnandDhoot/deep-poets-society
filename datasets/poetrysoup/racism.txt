we is still working the farms
my people still not read
my children still not write
my wife killed for be a negro
jim crow follow me everywhere
they hanging My people
 white people put fancy clothes on 
 watch us die
they find way to Keep kiLLing us
no Money to fight back
they take my people rights away
wE given no chancE to be better
the People say we are equal
we not jIm crow only follow us
the lynch rope only come after my people
we not good enough to eat with white skins
we taught to respect white skins
THEY SAY WE NO GOOD
TheY saY wE grOsS
