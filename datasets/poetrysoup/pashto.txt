Silent Lies

Silent Lies 

Silent lies
Silent tries
Silent deceptions upon the meek
Blaming Yahudi or any others of different speak
Whoever doesn’t subscribe to propaganda’s blubber

The gardens of Babylon had both fools and gardeners

False accusations
False assumptions
Defiling peace, a sad interruption
Deception is the tool of the propaganda’s fool
Silent lies, yet on and on do they try

The gardens of Babylon had both fools and gardeners

Hiding behind his many monikers and dark lit screens
Many of us are crying cause one of us is lying
Hate wrapped in well wishes
Love wrapped in ancient vendettas
Deception hiding in his own confessions

The gardens of Babylon had both fools and gardeners

While the sickness spreads upon her breast
Silent ones, wandering along the poetic path
Seeking brides with beauty to accept both cane and wrath
Deception and lies all dancing in the rain
Once bitten, most lovers know never to take that train

The gardens of Babylon had both fools and gardeners

Never praise the fool
Never kill the gardener
The ancients lost their wisdom
Repeat not the tribulations of the Iraq

The gardens of Babylon had both fools and gardeners

Silent lies, truth cries
Silent ghosts, phantoms dance
Deception mixed in romance
Fools mange the mirage of silent lies

The gardens of Babylon had both fools and gardeners
