The Old China Doll

Perched on a shelf is a china doll that stood immobile for over a decade.
Her eyebrows are arched in eternal surprise. Two eyes of magnified shades of amber fire in June's direction. Mira hisses at her, but June waves a bony finger
"leave her alone, we need her casting words to finish off the spell"
Mira reluctantly plunks herself on the window sill. "well shame on me "
June begins her chant, "Izzy doll of lint and glint, come now sprint!"
Izzy opens her eyes eyes and the first two words out of her unzipped mouth
are "HELP ME" June takes the owl shaped key from the dollies chest and
opens the cedar box to retrieve Izzy's favorite silk ribbon.
"A girl that's smartly dressed is a girl at her very best"
Izzy walks over to the cauldron, in a childlike voice she
chants then tampers with the elements to complete the sanctimonious brew.
