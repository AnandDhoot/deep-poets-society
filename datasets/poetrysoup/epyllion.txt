Matters of the Heart

The letters of the alphabet,
The creation of you,
The name i whispher to myself everytime,
Everytime i'm in need of your presence with me.

How wonderful it is,
To have someone that you hold so dear,
As if the world is going to end the next minute,
(Though it never ends)
To have someone that loves you through seasons,
Be of sadness or joy;laughter or fights,
To have someone that stands by to lend a helping hand,
Everytime that you are in need of one,
To have someone that fully understands you,
And appreciates even the littlest things you do.

Your joy is my joy,
And so is your frown my own.
I will love you till you stop me,
And tell me the page is full,so flip another.
I will hold you so tight to my heart,
Like a baby clings to the mother,
Because every single second that i am with you,
Is equals an eternity of my happiness
