I Can't Tell You

You always make me smile when I look at you.
When you see me smiling you say "what"
I don't want to tell you that I have strong feelings for you.
You can't see that you're breaking my walls down.
I can't tell you I'm falling for you when you are talking to someone else.
So I say "I don't know."
