Hackers

The actual pressure must be made more pressing by
adding to it consciousness of pressure, the shame must
be made more shameful by publicizing it.     Karl Marx


Edward, Julian & freaky Chelsea:
Why didn't they hack Time Warner &
Give the People something useful,
Like a good 5-cent doobie,
Free high-speed internet & cable TV
Including Canadian hockey &
MILF porn channels?
