Precious Moon

Yonder light of moon-kissed rays
on blessed breeze you lie
under cover of the milky way
reach out to every cusp of sky

Moon my precious moon
open your wings
open your gilded wings
now and evermore 

Shine your sultry soul
here into mine
into the loneliness of dusk
near thee enter upon me
endless glows of your
sacred smile

Fly high moon my precious moon
over my wayward path
reigning me home

Mysterious lady  let this butterfly dance 
effortlessly in the glint of your romance
