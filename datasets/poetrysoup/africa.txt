Coming of Rain

The medicine man's face frowned,
as he looked up at the blue sky.
It was beautifully blue,
but didn't have a cloud or raindrop in it.
"The Rain God is still asleep," the medicine man said.
"Who will wake him up?" an elder asked.
Without any words, the medicine man told everyone to pray for rain.
After prayers, the rains came!
"That's how you wake the Rain God!" the medicine man said.
