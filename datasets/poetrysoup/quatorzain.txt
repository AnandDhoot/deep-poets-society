Soaring New Heights


Two birdies j o u n c i n g in their nest,
    Getting ready to fly with zest,
One of them hops out all at once,
    The other chirrups feeling tense,
Their dad stands near watching proudly,
    Their mom rushes chirping loudly,
Fluttering wings, jittery tweets,
    From branch to sky, the birdie fleets,
The other birdie soon jumps out,
    With more caution than fear or doubt,
Shrill animated trills delight,
    Elated to make their first flights,
Balancing, flying, they alight,
   Having flown well, soaring new heights.
