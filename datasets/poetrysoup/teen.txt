Thoughts

I smile fading into the darkness of my room
quiet and unaware the feelings about to flee my head.
Being alone is one of my biggest fears
over thinking is the issue
silver coming out red, regrets and wishing I was dead,
hurting the ones I can't stand to see sad
it's not my fault the monsters in my head want me dead.
Craving my tears and full attention
being alone is a big fear of mine because
I can't ever trust my head it goes from thoughts
of happiness to wishing I was dead.
