Dancing in the moonlight

Dancing in the moonlight

Celestial lights 
flicker
in
heavens expanse

Harvest moon
beckons
us to
dance

it's mango luminosity
caresses
the black sky

embellishing
our 
romantic escape

Ever so softly,
in a quiet
undertone

Pat Metheny
is playing his 
smooth jazz
and 

we move 
involuntarily
to the dance floor

and we begin
to sway to the music
my arms wrapped around you tight

ohh feels soo good

all my cares 
drift away, floating
into oblivion

as  we gaze 
into 
each others eyes

knowing 
that tonight
everything 
is just right

dancing with you
in the moonlight
