Shaping Life - in Five Words


 
Doesn't it seem- life is pre-destined -
 a perfect roundel 
unfolding as it should.
We - who shape our destinies 
build them in tiny increments 
We note infinity as a buffer zone 
between us and death.
If life has a shape -it is where we are
It can be a bustling city, 
crammed with people, pollution and sirens.
It can be a fresh, uncluttered ocean shore, 
or a forest, benevolent with butterflies.

For Timothy's Five Words Contest
Infiniti, roundel. Forest, shape, butterflies.
