Behold the mighty pyramids

Behold the mighty pyramids that stand beside the Nile.
The pyramids appear amid three hungry crocodiles
Who are swimming down the Nile in a hungry single file
As they eye a wading anglophile a mile down the Nile.
And in awhile these crocodiles, now three satisfied reptiles, 
Reappear amid the pyramids with three horrid toothy smiles.
