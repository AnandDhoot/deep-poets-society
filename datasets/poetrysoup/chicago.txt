Present fear

The past is gone the future's not here so we live in the present gripped by fear.
                     Afraid to go walking or go to the store.
The warm summer nights that used to be pleasant have now turned
frightening with danger ever present. What ever happened to that time long ago
                     When strangers would smile and say hello.
Safe passage has left us much like the past when you never heard a fatal gun blast. the violence grows greater year after year as we live in the present 
gripped by our fear.
