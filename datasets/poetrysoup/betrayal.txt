Confessional at midnight

They say our youth is fulminantly dysfunctional yet we thrive and celebrate as one
The air teaming with spontaneous, burgeoning laughter;
A sign of uncompromising resolve to be unique yet together as we drink.
Perplexed, they ask, what is it that we are all after?

Is it the mutual understanding that madness is sanity?
That there are no limiting factors?
That we cannot compromise on our freedoms?
Surely... they sense this and know it matters.

For these hours we forget the ruin resulting from the crass way of the world.
Purposefully 'mistaking' friendship for flattery.
Dis-inhibition, at its brilliant best,
dances between heavy eyes and bright melancholy.

There are mixed emotions, along with the notion of forgotten trysts.  
Our bodies scream out heavy infidelities.
Yes... the best deceptions are won when staring into 'innocent' eyes. 
Why pretend to recall forgotten memories?

Dear heart, be whole; dear mind, be quiet.
Let me not be ruined to win the 'good fight'.
Let us not pretend to be saints, when we are sailors?
Oh... the false stories borne from premature judgement, right? 

As the clocks reflect the twilight hours,
Let us not hide in the places we have come to fear the most.
Break convention;
Be free and boast!
