Limerence - My love for you

Even on the day of resurrection, my soul shall search for yours, 
When all feared souls struggle to see their scores, 
My eyes will be looking for you, 
What evidence you need to prove my love for you? 

Sun will melt, rocks will fly in air and earth will vomit hidden things 
You will witness fearful sea of souls all around, 
Out of all, one soul will be different 
What evidence you need to prove my love for you? 

No false promise, no stars or moon, nor child in your womb, 
My love is immortal, I love not thee body, why to build a tomb? 
You shall see one soul following yours, 
What evidence you need to prove my love for you? 

Am not afraid to follow you, be it heaven or hell. 
My eternal love for you, demand our togetherness 
Who cares how, what and where? 
What else you need to prove my love for you?
