                            FIRST LOVE

              Our glances adored each other
              as we chanced to meet.
              First love at first sight just in teen.
             He never spoke to me.
              I got no opportunity to interact.

             On my study leave of six months,
             I watched him from far balcony.
             We wandered in the park keeping distance.
             Neither he nor I opened mouth.
            Yet silent world was romantic.
             Love-seed was sowed and sprouted in mind.
             Root pierced the heart in pain.
             Stem of emotion spread two passionate leaves.

             On last eve of my departure
            I was alone to loiter in the park,
           He was alone to walk on side-road.
           On sudden boost he entered the park.
           We stood close to each other.
            I was not shy but looked direct at his eyes
            with earnest desire and expectation.
               He could not utter a syllable.
