the bath house

The Bath-House
When I was twelve years old I discovered
a bath-house near the docks we didn`t have a bathroom 
at home only a toilet for four families.
In I went- I had my intrepid moment- cubicles were you
Could undress in peace get a piece of soap, a towel which 
was  a novelty. 
My first shower, god how I loved it warm water and soap 
I might have, no, I don`t think so that came later.
I had a shower as often as I could the bath-house was shut
on Saturdays and holidays.
It was incredibly  cheap but for a boy 1 Krona was much
I had to ask my aunt for money to buy sweets and shamelessly
used them for my secret vice. 
Well, the bath-house has gone a block of expensive flats with
a view of the harbour. Everything changes but not always 
for the better
