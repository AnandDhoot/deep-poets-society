WALKING A MILE WITH YOU

Walking a mile with you is easy
Knowing  you are there.

Walking  a mile is easy
As you guide me through my fears
Leading me, showing how much you care.

Walking a mile with you 
Seem short and sweet, 
As you are always protecting my feet. 
Giving courage, strength and empowerment.

Ah!  The joy we share as we
hold hands, as you whisper in my ear. 
Hugging me snuggly,   
yes, walking a mile with you is easy.
