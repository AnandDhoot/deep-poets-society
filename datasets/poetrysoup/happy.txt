BANJO

Eternal Demon Princess,
ascending into cursed adolescence,
blossoming into a lady of beauty
while spinning devilishly with emotion

Even when she throws rocks instead of bread,
this Catfish will always defend her pond
whether it is from vile insects with dripping fangs
or evil shadows terrorizing her room in the night

Raised by the best mother goddesses I've ever known,
you mean more than the world to me
Your heart is worth more than all the sammiches in the world
and I will always love you with every fiber of my being

Here's to 12 years on Spaceship Earth

May you continue to bloom into a vision of beauty,
like the orchid that blooms in the cover of night,
and always feel the love I carry for you

The Only Kind Of Fish Who Likes To Swim,
Your Catfish
