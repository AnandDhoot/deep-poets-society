Blushed Naivety

Her lips still blushed a youthful favor

     amidst burnished summer's spirit,

scintillating 'tween impetuous kisses

 whilst naivet√© blooms gullible bosoms,

embraced afore a chill nature 

  withering budding wildflowers

    taking precedence o'er accorded doctrines  

          farthermost harmonious freewill
