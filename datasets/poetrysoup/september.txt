September

She was too busy, racing for nowhere,
hunting for directions; I couldn't go. 
Warm and breezy; o why can't I pause now?
Life will soon fail in face of the snow.

So strange to start beginnings and still strive, 
to plan for other futures all the while. 
My soul is torn, loyalties divided,
I watch all my plans burn in a pile. 

Too late to capture anything, too late!
Water dripping from my hands into void.
Failed; responsibility remains.
Can't it see I am already destroyed? 

September! You thrashed my hopes and my dreams!
Rememberâ€”peace is never as it seems.
