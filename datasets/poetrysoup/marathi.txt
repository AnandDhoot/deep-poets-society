Sexual love 
What do you do when your lover is a thief?
What could I do smitten as I was by her sexual allure
she looked like Marilyn Monroe but lacked her
honesty and innocence while my lover as a taker Marilyn
was a giver, but what could I do?
She was a sickness a cold that would not go away, I often
left her in anger vowing not to return, but I did
despised myself as I sold my car to keep her in style and
expensive restaurant.
Every bad situation comes to an end she knocked
down by a speeding car, the one I had sold.
With my last money I bought a big wreath her mother cried 
I was glad she had gone which brought on a depression 
because no one had done it as good as her.
