I Fumble

Scuffling in the depths of the ghetto
Plagued by trouble
Lost in an isolated humanity
Gambling with my life playing in stubble

I fumble

A promise of vengeance
For my non-deliverance
Reality is my craziness
Apprehended by my silliness

I crumble

Desolation following me to oblivion
Self-destruction swallowed into this situation
Delusional from the inhalation

I stumble
