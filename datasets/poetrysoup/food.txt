Feasting on Poetry

The poesy of chef's soup du jour,
   peppered in a skillfully delectable
            pauperized simmer
       or sublimely enriched dish of
          ultimate truffle butter grandeur,
   either method is subtly rendered mid
      tastefully tendered aromatic
              proffers of broken bread,  
          farther delectable poetry's bouquet
