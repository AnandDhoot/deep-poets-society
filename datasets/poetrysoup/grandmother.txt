Granny Bess.

With spectacles placed on the edge of her nose
she poised her pen to write.
Deep in thought of the days ups and downs
she began to write that night.
As she remembers her friends who called
to share her cake and tea.
She remembered as they left her home
how happy they seemed to be.
But truth was Granny Bess, her mind was not
quite right, for she forgot to wear her new red dress
so gave them all a fright.
Even the spectacles sitting on the edge of her nose
blind as a bat was Granny Bess she wore very little clothes
But then again, it's my Granny Bess
who invites her friends for tea.
Then likes to write the days events and share them all with me.
