COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, MALAWI


In the deep veins of her corridors
Flow thick blood of academic Excellency
Dwelling in the hearts of her blocks
Is the dream to serve the nation

Patiently we had to wait 
for the lovely and beautiful expectant UNIMA.
To give birth to her, the giant of the land.

The fourth labor of mother UNIMA
Yielded this bouncing baby of the warm heart of Africa
Standing still with her pillars in the armpit
The armpit of great Masauko Chipembere highway

She is the real reason. The reason, 
Why Malawi swims in the deep rivers of Africa.
Across the borders raising its flag in the white manâ€™s land

We have never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that joy and celebrations will find their way.
Out of our minds and into every corridor of hers.
Tears of happiness flowing down the cheeks of Blantyre

The day when every institution trembles with fear
Bowing down to this great conqueror of the land
Crowning her as the great Queen
With her kingdom celebrating 25 years of victory
The silver jubilee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
