Inquisition


Eight hundred years ago,
do you recall what happened?
Are you aware,
do you know?
Well, it's happening again today,
so I suggest you find out
I urge you to find out right away
Wait, what's that you say,
you want to hear it from moi?
Mmm ... I don't know about that,
I'm not sure your ears can handle it
Understand this: I'm a truth-teller
I uncover hidden dark lies,
expose them to the glare of the light
In the thirteenth century,
the Roman Catholic church established a tribunal,
whose job it was to find and kill
all heretics and unbelievers
The Dark Age of the Inquisition had begun
Investigate heresy;
suppress any objections,
get a tortured confession
Fill up the dungeons,
where they're now free
to rot and die for protesting
that Christ never said, "hate thy enemies"
The Inquisition has been revived,
medieval times are once again alive
And like before,
we must trust in God to help us survive
