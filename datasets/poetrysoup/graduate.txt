:Mother, Father, Brother, Sister:

My mother says that I'll never see. 
My father says that I'll never hear. 
My brother I'll never get higher than a C. 
My sister says I'll never tolerate beer. 
  Every day, my family puts me down. 
They say that they're just being realistic.
But there is one thing they didn't put on that excuse mound. 
That they're not perfect, they're never optimistic. 
   Studies show that the reason bullies
Put others down, 
Isn't to please,
Not because they find pleasure in the pound;
Not because they like to tease,
But that it brings them up. 
To the brim of their cup. 
   Mom, I see that you're an alcoholic, 
    Dad, I hear that you're in a financial rut. 
Brother, I've gotten all A's and and one B. But not higher than you are on your drugs. 
Sister, you were right. Unlike you, I won't drink, or portray myself as a slut. 
And Uncle?
Thank you. 
For helping my grades up to A's and B's. 
For prohibiting drinking and drugging. 
And...,
For opening my eyes and ears,
To see and hear,
That it's not me. 
It's them.
