Words

Words are spoken,words are written,words are heard,words are read.
Words are knives, words are hammers,words are salves,words are bread.

Words will make you the star of your own private show,
Words will make you the loser of your own race,
Words will make you fear seeing that one face.
Words will make you go where few dare to go,
Words will make you know what others know,
Words will make you very hard to replace.

Words are the answer,
Words are the question as well.
Words are the beginning phrase,
Words are the last hope.
Words are the great game changer,
Words are the final statement.
