Systematically contrived dust

The universe is immeasurable,
  we are merely infinitesimal
      machinery keeping pace,
as churning cogs tick wildly 
  transmitting within allotted time, 
attempting heartbeats' cohesion
  clocking our own honed destinations,
accumulating illusions 'tween masses
   waiting to return as a speck of dust
      in the never-ending saga of
           inexhaustible collectives amidst
         systematically creative contrivances
