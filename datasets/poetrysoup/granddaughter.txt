Sandbox


It seems like it was yesterday
   in backyard sandbox she had played;
      granddaughter loved to have her way
         with sand, her pail, scoop, shovel, spade.

She'd mold and build, with special care;
   imagination took its form.
      Sometimes she'd throw it up in air
         to watch it fly like a sandstorm.

Fast forward now just twenty years:
   our princess then, in her play sand,
      now lives a life on new frontiers
         soon headed for another land.

A first lieutenant based stateside,
   her unit soon will be deployed
      to mid-east base, Kuwait, supplied
         with desert sand, so vast and void.

Her 'sandbox' then, to serve with troops,
   logistics and supplies command,
      where sand is pushed with 'dozer 'scoops'...
         and windstorms fill the air with sand.

It seems like it was yesterday
   in backyard sandbox, she had played.
      As West Point grad, she makes her way
           to serve our country, unafraid.
