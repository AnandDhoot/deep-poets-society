Hunkering Down

Ready or not here he comes
Best you batten down the hatches
Unless you were one of the smart ones to run 
Like a Coon Hound in July chasing rabbits

Alright, alright, alright
As you turn and face the wind
Open the door to a Category 4
And let Matthew come screaming in

Oh me, oh my, oh my, oh me
Is that Grandma in the yard below
Hanging tight with all her might to the clothes line 
With her cat Skeeters in tow

This is getting rather exciting
As I see trees by the dozen crack in half
With my Boy scout skills I might need to later build
A sturdy family size raft

But for now we'll all hunker down
Try and stay away from the windows
And all the flying debris that I decided to leave
In the yard scattered between plastic Flamingos 

I'm here wondering at this moment
Which of the two could be worse
Being blown away by a hurricane 
Or eaten by a gator face first 

Still you've got to love Florida
With 20 foot waves crashing to shore
As I step outside to grab that branch floating by
I think I need to start whittling some oars

I live in Jacksonville Florida and thought some humor would be nice before my power goes out and I crawl off into a corner to whimper...
