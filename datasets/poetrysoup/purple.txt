Colour Me Perfect

Colour Me Perfect

Colour me violet
Keep my world in inviolate
Colour me lilac
Keep my spirit bright
Colour me red
For you, sons and daughters, I will bear.
Colour me yellow
Sooth me mellow.
Colour me green
On my finger, put a ring.
Colour me blue
Let's elope to pastures new.
Colour me orange
Awaiting us is a mirage.
Colour me cerulean
My heart is yours for millenniums.
Colour me scarlet
Let's dine in candlelight.
Colour me Sepia
I am yours for ever.
Colour me rainbow
Colour me perfect.
