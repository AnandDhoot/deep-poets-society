I need to walk away

I have to work
I have to smile
I have to be patient
I have to live with those people 
Who are all always hate me,
Because I have no choice 
Because i can't go away
Because I am human being.
I have to moderate myself
I have to encourage 
I have to protect me
From all of the hell 
Because everything is disgusting in my life.
Because I am human being.
I need to breathe 
I need to long sleep
for fill up my restless time
I need to see dream
I need to do something new
because I want to be happy
because I am human being.
I have to avoid all those things
Which Irritate me tease me all the time.
And 
I need to walk away
I need to walk away
I need to live before die
Because I am human being.
