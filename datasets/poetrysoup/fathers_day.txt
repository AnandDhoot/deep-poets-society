Oh Father's Day

Here’s a poem, a rhyme, a lyric for thee,
I’ll post it to online because it is free.

It salutes and exults your role in our lives,
Your bravery and fairness and strength make us thrive. 

Our kids are all cool and sturdy and stable,
Because of your firm hand and you’re the head of our table.

You protect your own with the fiercest of growls and those that have felt it,
You’ve made move their bowels.

I could go on forever because this is fun, 
But will stop now and wish you,

A Happy Father’s Day Mum.
