Atrophic Royalty

Too much
Silence
So much
Violence
All is
Discordance

Mother
Father
Bother

I was born a daddy's girl
And i knew my heart would curl
Behind his brick wall
Learning how to fear before i could crawl

Not enough
Patience
Break down
Communication
Every day
Complaisance

Love
Bullet
Swallow

My soul is an over-encumbered whore
With a lovingly withered empty core
I'm not hiding anything from your eyes
I grew to be all my daddy despises

Love brought
Complication
No more
Hesitation
Gun powder
Combustion

Shake me
Break me
Rape me
Kill me
