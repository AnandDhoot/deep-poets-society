Sorrow Not Hope

It's a forgotten graveyard 
by an untraveled, murky road...
where wild grass and clinging vines quckly grow;
If sun rays didn't break through, it wouldn't glow.

Many children talking loud on their way to school
glance at it, and rushing by do whisper
among themselves, " Be quite, they will
wake up and scare you." Another kid says , "Fool,
they can't harm anyone, they will sleep 'till
Judgement Day, instead say some prayer."

I was one of those kids who often heard the priest speak to believers
strenghtening their faith with words deeply sad,
" Death is a period of long sleep into the earth so deep
awaiting trumpets to awaken those fallen asleep...
when all graves will open up and give up each dead."
Even mom mentioned such a glorious event  coming unexpectedly,
'" Son, don't be afraid, but rejoice: Christ will hold the scepter of victory!"

On Rememberance Day, I pulled the ugly vines
off the crumbling tombstones and placed flowers 
underneath them and praying silence broke;
I could read all the names...too happy to have dared...
sufdenly a lark swooped down and stared and wondered,
 " Why does death bring sorrow not hope? "
