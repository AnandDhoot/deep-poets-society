Mermaid

I become a real
mermaid by your side, but just
like in that danish 

fairy-tale, I shed 
no tear when I cry; make no 
sound when my heart is

broken; smile when I
dance on razorblades of your 
human love; cease to

exist by turning
to sea foam when the love of 
yours toward me is no more.
