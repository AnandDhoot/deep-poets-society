The Summer I Was Fourteen

It was packed. Hot and steamy.
Bathroom breaks were rare. 
And so was food. We arrived and it
Was heavily filled. We left and it
Was deserted.

Wednesday. He fell. The ER
Calling out our name but we
Ignored it. Finally basic care was
Met with an angry boy. Fighting 
To be left alone.

11:00 PM. We rushed and were helped.
Patience is nowhere to be found. 
Barfbags, fake doctors, unicorns and
More kept us company throughout the
Night. Finally, we left too tired to do anything.

It beckoned us to it’s comfy linens. To it’s warmth.
We couldn’t resist. Just one night we said.
We were fed one meal. Then we departed.
The long journey would be over soon. One more
Night and it would all be over.

Friday. It was filled with canoeing and
Kayaking. Flirting and 20-second relationships.
Water fun and water incidents. Pain and relief.
We were ready for home. Though another 
adventure awaited us the moment we arrived.
