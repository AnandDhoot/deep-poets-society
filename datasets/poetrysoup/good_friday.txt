Reflecting A Game Lost


Hohoho. .. 
The speedy black panther strikes again...
3-2 in his favor, what can I say, having lost again...
Maybe there is a real need for some serious urine test...
Yup sounds like sour grapes but I would want to protest. ..
After doing 2-2 with another player, how can he play like a fresh daisy...
Power and speed was still his forte, so much so I looked positively lazy...
For the record, thought I've had him all figured out...
When I did lead him 2-1, maybe a momentous win was in the works...
Then he pulled his game together and went to work...
Suddenly it was 2-2 and we're into the decider. ..
Long story short, he prevailed and was the winner...
Hohoho... 
The black panther strikes again....
