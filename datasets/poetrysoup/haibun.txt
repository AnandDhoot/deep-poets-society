haibun stories


How strange that in heart’s ache, I thought to write of one who brought on the despair, which has since deliquesced, that I can now delight in memory, floating back on daydreams, to waves dancing on a shore to her merry tunes, whistling with the birds, unseen in the canopy.

lush greens shade soft sands
coconut palm leans forward
the sea strokes the tree

She lived passionate with compassion, immersing those around in all her joys, angers, sorrows, and generous giving, even as the riches of nature abounded, gloriously light-touched. The first born child on the new island, she was as one with it, though the surrounding ocean always called. 

dawn stills in night cool
morning shines with dew refreshed
the sun stretches long

By day, she toiled in the fields, tromped over the hills, wove mats from tree fronds, collected fruits, and thought of fishing. By night, her spirit would remain restless, unless she was by the seashore. In the light of moon, stars, lanterns, and torches, we explored the tide pools and rocky caverns, gathering goodies. Many times, we’d sit on a rock, fishing till the tide came in, then wade back to the shallows; or we’d rock gently on a boat, by a reef, till the storm clouds blew their warning. In the passing time, she’d tell her stories, and into all that background magic, she poured in so much more.

sting rays glide in waves
feet tread slowly in low tide
sea goddess not touched
