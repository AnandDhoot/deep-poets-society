Meet me in an ecstasy

See me where
the palms scrape the skies,
where the exquisiteness of life 
cannot be deprived of
Sense me between 
the sheet s of dampness
Love & adore me in the
hot waves of 
a midsummer gust
I want you around
I want you here & there
forever
meet me in an ecstasy
where we can 
spend our time together

Saumya Aloysius
