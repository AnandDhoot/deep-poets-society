LIFE IN COLORED PHASES


Life is a phase
Full of energy like my son's crayon
It open up in pages
Flipping through in no rhythm of colors
Our dreams are often in cage
Strings and tunes are in block colors
Yesterday paces up in phases
With a lot of good memory in black
Today is like a snail with no pace 
Hoping that this present peace will still be white
Tomorrow soars to the heaven in a chase
Life is then fine-tuned to a shade of colors
Just like a detective writer Hadley Chase
With a dance of colorless tune in sight
We have made for our generations a good case
Our dream is a like green with no fertility
Sometimes like rotten food, it get decayed
Yet we smile with our faces red in anger
Holding the future rainbow with the mace
