SONNET IV: Reason

SONNET IV
Reason

For what Reason of Morale,
Do men Fight?
For what benefit of Existence,
Do men Combat?

Dogs! They lack the Sanity of a Fold,
Hence struggle to make all Benefits.
Dogs struggle, Sheep don’t.
Dogs bark, Sheep don’t.

Man is a Source of shelter and a Definition to Sanity.
A Source of living, the Crown of creation.
Mummy; hear her anxious call.
As you go Son, Remember Your Fold.
The Son of whom you are; Forget Not.
To err is Human, to forgive is Divine.
