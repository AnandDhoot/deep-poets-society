Song Of Love

(Sung to the tune of “Traces of Love’)

Hold me in your arms
Let me feel your touch of love
Keep me feeling warm
You’re the one I’m thinking of
So tenderly, O my love, you touch me with your eyes
It’s no surprise – I’m in love with you

Hold me in your eyes
Let me taste your fond affection
For you are my prize
You’re the answer to my question
That long I’ve asked, O my love, could love be sweet as this?
Tender the kiss that tells me love is you

Chorus:
Hold me, my love
For if you do
My heart will sing to you
The song of “I Love You”

Hold me in your mind
When the distance separates us
If perhaps you find
That the world isolates us
For if you do, O my love, I’ll hold you in my heart
When we’re apart we’ll know our love is true

Hold me in your soul
I will strive to love and guide you
Not too fast or slow
Always walking right beside you
If you are weak, O my love, I’ll help you to be strong
We’ll sing our song of love in harmony
