THE REASON, I FAILED

                   Was it, the one for me

         The red eyes and the pale face

                 That got my front seat

                 Was it, the one to teach

         The reasons not to waile at thee

                  ends of a happy fight

               Rejections in their dress

             That impressive statement

                     " You suck at this"

                Will seduce your mind 

                and keep you up at night

           Like bacterial on an old wine

               Your dreams but a note

         In the strings of a music laugh

            Will echo in times that past

       I sat with failure and she danced

           to the tunes rejection played.

               She then stole my heart

              We married and had, hate

        Eventually, she grew up to date

        "Depression" his name he; says

             The thaughts of memories

                    That linger all day

                     I became of age

          Now I have written over a page 

         stereotypes i face today, from they;

             To let you know I cannot fight 

                   For I am bound to fail

                  With my name on sale
