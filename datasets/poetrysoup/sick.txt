Please Forget Me When I Am Gone

Follow me, my sweet-
Take my hands and allow me to ease your troubled mind. 
I have been through madness and disease, and yet-
Here you are inside my world living in completeness. 
I am nothing but a lost puppy without your embrace. 
I have seen mountains of wonder, and nothing compares to 
the charm you carry with such grace.
Oh, please forget me when I am gone-
For the loss of me is too severe to hold onto without 
breaking your soul in half. 
You are my other half; complete me tonight so we may 
always remember our gentle momentsâ€¦ we so cherish. 
I know death seems so dark, but release me into the arms of the 
angels and I will never leave your side. 
I needed you in life but you need closure in my death.
And my sweet, after you let go...
please, forget me when I am gone-
For the loss of me is too overwhelming for one man to subdue.
