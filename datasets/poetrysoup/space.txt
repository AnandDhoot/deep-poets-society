Dreams Beyond Dreams



There are places out in space
that beg the question of why,
abiding where dreams embrace
our infinite inner sky.

Stargazers pay attention
to sidereal pathways,
tracing every dimension,
some using astral math ways.

Scientists study each fact
and what their instruments find
of astronomic impact
in terms of matter and mind.

The poets wordily lithe
of celestial wonders sing
with lofty spirits and blithe
as upward their fancies wing.

Throughout human death and birth
we’ve gazed at the heavens awed
while creating hell on earth
through cause and effect that’s flawed.

We see not with precision
through mortal perceptions, but
with illusory vision
pretentiously say what’s what.

And yet, if the truth be told,
in our braggadocio
of verities we behold,
how little we truly know!

There are dreams beyond our dreams
that fly in the face of fear,
where all is more than it seems
to casual eye and ear.

In evolution stellar
a flash was observed in view
from dying cosmic dweller
that brought it to life anew…

If stars come back from the dead
reborn in a blaze of light,
who knows what might lie ahead
beyond our limited sight?
