MY NAME IS BILL

My Name is Bill!
The mist clears
Lavender green and lavender grey
Again!
On the menu
Creme caramel.
Honeydew dreams 
I remember from yesterday.
 
If only. If only  I was solvent
Again,
My bed feathered
My dog coiffeured
My wife would gaze at me lovingly.
 
 
But it is cold 
And I  am motherless, friendless,
Wifeless!
On the streets: stone cold.
My rockweiler and my lice as my 
Only company.
 
 
 
* To all the homeless living on the streets.
