Grieve Forgotten Souls

Hidden on a lonely old daunting road

Dark and melancholy clandestine

Cemetery weary of last tears sowed.



Undecipherable daunting shrines

Bracing cold marble and granite tombstones

Deeply rooted in hard defiant earth matter

Some leaned drunkenly upon its groans

Others stood in various states of disrepair

Cracked or chipped,  inscriptions , some eroded smooth

mats of moss,  and ivy clasp to its bosoms.



Forgotten as they start to fade,  embraced

in wild vegetation,  pits and mounds of

decaying falling trees, and lace lichen.

Uncertain of how many vessels interred there

haunting the graveyard that time has soothe.



Sad voices from the past echo

overwhelming weeping emotions

expressed sorrow and grief that wonâ€™t let go.

Lived a life,  but some died as an unknown

in its stillness surrounded not wanting

to be alone watching the world grow old.



I step into this unforgotten cemetery,

embracing  a bouquet of  yellow roses in my arms

looking for a departed loved one.


To no avail


I laid a single  rose  and said a silent prayer 

with tears of wonder and sadness

and grieve for all these forgotten souls.
