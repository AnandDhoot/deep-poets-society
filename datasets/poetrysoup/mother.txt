Green Ceramic Table

Green Ceramic Table

We had a 60's green oblong ceramic table;
Which had two extentions to fit our family.
This table exemplified our loving unified families domain.

Brings back many beautiful memories of  sweet smelling apple pie
Cinnamon rolls, turkey all dressed up with the best stuffing made
from my beautiful mothers loving hands. 
 
Upon the exquisite memories Uncle John would stand up and say
with the purest of heart our prayers to which we all would be
blessed upon this day.

At the end he would always say, "God bless this green ceramic table
that Mary has given us this exceptional meal and keep everyone blessed
forever with tender love within your glorious hands and arms.

From this day forward and through the future years to come: May
God bless this beautiful green ceramic table.
                                                       AMEN!!
