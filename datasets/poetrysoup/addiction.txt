The Sky

Star light,
Star bright,
What do you see,
In the sky tonight,
Midnight blue,
Subtle view abroad,
Pictures you believe,
Set together in the stars,
Clouds then,
A tint of white to be,
Flowing through the air,
With a slight wind,
Beyond eternity,
Another life above,
Sparkles and shines,
The midnight sky were below,
Wondering how it has been done,
A glimpse of glimmer,
A feel of hope,
Know it's all beautiful,
If you take time,
And look up,
The lighting of the sky,
The abundance of views,
A different reaction from all,
The opinions you have,
As well as the views,
Another life,
A history it's own above,
Thanking the heavenly father,
For all the mysteries unknown,
A lit up view,
When morning comes near,
The miracles in front of us,
Seem all to clear,
Take the chance,
Look up at the midnight blue,
For one day,
We all will be in it,
In the midnight sky thats true....
