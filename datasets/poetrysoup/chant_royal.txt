The Coming Of The Day

The Coming Of The Day 

Prayers sent,
Tears spent,
Strength lent,
Pipeline to be circumvent.

Broken Promises and lies,
Uniting of many tribes,
Waiting for a judge of man to surmise,
And Great Spirit to decolonize.

Black Snake of greed,
You thought we were a "vanishing breed",
The reptile met the spirit steed,
Oil is not the Native creed.

Upon treaty lands you slither near,
It is songs and prayers that you will hear,
From prophecies and spiritual seers,
You crawled into the Standing Rock sphere.

Where Sitting Bull's spirit dwells,
Where Crazy Horses' courage compels,
And Chief Gall's stands still and rebels,
Sacred Lakota parallel.

Disturbed graves and uncovered bones,
You really should have left them alone,
Together the eagle and condor has flown,
The dead are not powerless nor are they gone.

We've been waiting on you for centuries now,
Since the birth of the white bison cow,
To you we make our own avow,
The sacred tree lives and we are the boughs.

What Wovoka spoke was all true,
The buffalo's return gave proof,
The Father says so and it is long overdue,
And now you have much to hitherto.
