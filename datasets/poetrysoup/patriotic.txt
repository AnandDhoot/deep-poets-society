A patroit

a city built
without a proper defends
is easily trod down
and if a kingdom tears apart 
strangers wears it crown
a nation who do not 
honor it heroes
is not worthy to die for 
and it dreams are hunted
by nightmares and horror
each a one for himself
god for us all
it does not only rain 
on one mans roof
and a nation built 
is built on truth
if you pretend to be blind 
you fall in a pit
in the kingdom of heaven 
only the righteous has a seat
a group of blind men 
cannot embark on a journey
for among all insects 
only the bee produces honey
the house of the fool is chaos
but that of the wise is paradise
for god do not live
in the heart of fools
but that of the wise
the mighty is not the strong
but he who is wise
for only an intelligent man 
saves a nation from slavery
and gives them a common identity
a bird is praised 
and its praised 
by it beautiful feathers
good traditions are not 
to be forgotten
because life is for the living
the story of a hero
is told from generation to generation
the strength of a nation 
is from its foundation
