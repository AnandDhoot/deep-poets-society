Welcome here all if customized hospitality is in your needs
My Restaurant- “Skyline Swishes” it’s name crystal board reads
Its a see-through double globe with deep-blue water in between
In it dancing dolphins; vibrant corals resplendent with their sheen
At the entrance, as you visit, a record of your mood is created
Does this for me, my mind reading machine “Metis” sophisticated!
If in pensive mood you enter, smiling mermaids swing you… 
To the top-most floor to elevate your spirits to fresh and new
Awesome ambience, appealing aroma , delicious food and stew
Desserts with nuts overload and to sip the delightful brew
If in happy mood you visit us then more joy and cheer you take
Troop of robots who play the stewards, no scope for any mistake  
First two floors of the three are yours to eat, enjoy and play
Your satisfaction is our prime motto, what more can I say?
Spacious lounge for all to relax, read or find some new pal
A pleasure-filled ideal soothing place to make a romantic call 
A speck of dust you will fail to trace even with magnifying lens
By my wonder chefs, a treat to taste buds of your family and friends
All you do is swipe the table on the picture of dishes of your choice
In a minute served at your table piping fresh and hot with spice…
The recipes here are cooked with passion, served with smile and love
My hearty invite, do come and check to experience all that I said above!
