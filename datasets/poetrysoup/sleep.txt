No Sleep

       Last night I had the hardest time going to sleep,
       No matter how hard I tried my mind just couldn’t seem to find peace,
       No matter how much I pleaded, my thoughts just wouldn’t cease.
	
	I’ve been thinking too much,
	My anxious thoughts keep coming at me in an uncontrollable rush,
	All that seemed to help was my boyfriend’s touch,
	It confused me but either way it happened as such.
	
	Sometimes comfort helps my anxiety,
	The things that seem to help my anxiety are in a variety,
	Though my anxiety seems to be worse when I’m in a state of sobriety,
	Yet what I hate most is when Ana lies to me.

	Sometimes Ana makes me feel like some kind of pun,
	I take ten steps backwards and a huge plunge,
	For I know there are still more sleepless nights to come.
