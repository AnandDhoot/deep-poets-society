- You Are A Special Friend -



I wish it was
a short distance between us
No mil to travel
Sharing a cup of coffee and an ice cream
Fill our days with smiles and laughter
Travel on an adventure in the world of poetry

Today on your birthday,
I wanted to tell you again
how much you mean
to me, dear Leonora
It pleases me
that we are friends

Wishing you happiness
on your birthday
and bright days in the future




                        HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR LEONORA !
                                         (Galeo DS)
