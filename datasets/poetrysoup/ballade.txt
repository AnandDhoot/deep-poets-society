Sexy midnight calls

The phone rings five
then four
then three,
then;hi!
hi,who is this?...
Francine?Is this Francine?
Francine who?
Francine my ex wife.
No,i'm not your Francine
that now is resting in a quarantine.
because of that bad disease.
Who are you?Are you Peter Griffin,who during the day
does nothing,and during the night
hit the hotline?
No, I am not Peter Griffin.
My bad,i rung the wrong number
but now in a blink
I'm gonna hung up
and have a blessed sleep
and a very blessed night.
Really?Nobody stays up at three in the morning 
and rings other peoples phones by mistake.
Tell me the truth
why you're up at this hour.
Personal.
My phone is personal too,
and you invaded my privacy.Now because of you,
I'll be up for the rest of the night
so tell me
what's your story.
I'ts a divorce.Has been a week that i can't sleep one second.
Try ambien with Kentucky bourbon. 
and you'll be fine.
I've tried everything
nothing works.
Then call me again 
tomorrow in the morning
maybe will think
of something.

He called this lady 
six nights in a row
from night
until in the morning
the seventh day
he fell asleep
and forgot to make phone ring.
Forgot or he did this thing in purpose
god knows
a robin
and a dove
they meet each other
in the middle of the day
very happy and madly in love.
