Resignation



			When you’re sucker-punched with frustration	
			and can’t find a cause for elation,
			when you’re unsuccessful
			and life’s super stressful,
			you surely will feel perturbation.

			When you face severe provocation
			and fear that there’s no mitigation
			for hard knocks life’s sending;
			you’re breaking, not bending.
			You seek means of self-preservation.

			You may sometimes feel the temptation
			to cave to complete trepidation.
			Don’t yield, I beseech you.
			The light may soon reach you
			if your mindset’s not resignation.

			*******************************

			When life is a race I’m not winning,
			my foundation needs underpinning.
			Time spent softly praying
			does help heal my fraying
			nerves—fragile from all that head-spinning!
