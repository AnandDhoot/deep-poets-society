First Trip

When we travel first time 
All alone to a new country 
Many worries will land 
Along with you at the airport. 

Somebody at the immigration 
Will be scanning our eyes 
Using the camera lenses 
To take an image of our worries, 
The colors of our dreams 
From our thumb impressions.
The dates of our solitude 
Will be stamped on our passport. 

San Francisco, when did I land 
Into your colorful dreams 
Like a silent computer robot 
By loaning my village memories.
