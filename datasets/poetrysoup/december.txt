Festive Year End Finale


All through the year it's been coming
the months, weeks and days countdown
then in that final month of the year
all the pressure makes one frown

It's the fastest paced month by far
everything's a gogo in December
all pointing to Santa time at Christmas
be ready get all the pressies remember!

Sadly the real reason for the season
has been lost in this materialistic world
God sent His son to be our saviour
instead man leaves the message curled

It can bring a mixture of weather
where ever in the world you may be
of course it's my birthday month
now let's find as real nice green tree
