Seed of Enlightenment

Blow the trumpets of glory
For the King is humble and lowly.i
Great is he who taught love,
Freedom and peace like a dove.
Who gave us power like lightening,
And planted the seed of enlightenment.

Hold His hand, see your adventure unfold,
Hidden treasure of God’s wisdom told
Grace better than diamonds or gold,
God is our Soul’s stronghold.
He was there when the night was dark and cold.

Engulf me in your embrace,
Like your beloved child.
My heart yours to reconcile.
My mind once hostile,
But now you’re the reason why I smile.


Hold His hand, see your adventure unfold,
Hidden treasure of God’s wisdom told
Grace better than diamonds or gold,
God is our Soul’s stronghold.
He was there when the night was dark and cold.
