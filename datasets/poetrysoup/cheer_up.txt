cooking life

dish up that successful life,starting from the heating of blood,
and chopping the pieces of brain
and adding some pain
in the pan.

a beautiful person does not live by fruity salads
but every tissue that i issue,
you feel the love of wiping the blood
 I say do not cry
not knowing that I'm making you cry even more
like chopped onions in the boiling oil,
that is cooking life.

you keep the challenges running for you
because of the aroma,
the deep cry after cry
pain after pain
expectation are running high and giving false hope 
that is cooking life
