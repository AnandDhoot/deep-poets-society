A Feather Lost


                   A feather lost glides, drifting, it soars,
in the mighty wind it twirls and swirls as if dancing,
     oh once, THE PEOPLE, owned all the wilderness,
they called it home, and now it is being destroyed.

                  High upon a sheer, jagged cliff a horse,
of many colors stands majestic under the azure sky,
     and an Ojibwa girl looks at the land of her Canada,
where below the Ottawa River thunders and roars.

                 In the wind that howls, eagle feathers,
in her raven hair and on her horse are fluttering,
       and in the sky above eagles fly and screech,
to symbolize her ancestors great spirit and strength.

               And in my dream, I am that Ojibwa girl,
who stands upon that cliff with her horse and feathers.
