Over Yonder:

As I gaze across the hidden valley,
Far off into the distance I see,
Sparkling lights are dancing yonder,
Dancing so precariously.
I close my eyes the lights fade out,
Now they dance inside me,
Still, ebb and flow in mysterious ways,
So I gaze again across the valley,
To see what I had seen before,
But sadly they were no more.
                /|\
