Don't You Agree

Don't you agree
that trees are green,
Or is it common sense
that hasn't changed for he,
Oh this reminds me
to twiddle De and twiddle dumb,
Both of you could be smart
with your brains and parts clumped,
Don't you agree
that spiders are spidery,
Flies are flying
and time is timing,
Oh this reminds me
i might need another look,
The thought would last longer
if i had a picture i took,
Don't you a agree
these rhymes are nursery,
When you say don't take it personal
someone takes it personally,
It's so crazy
how life is grazing,
We agree to disagree
don't you agree it's amazing.
