Conceal no more

What superficial concepts these are? When we are neither here or there 
When we conceal our hearts, when we hide elsewhere 

We claim to be invincible 
But we aim in that to maim
It is straight and true 
Who among us should take the blame? 

But why dress up what we say? Being dishonest with self
We must be honest in all we do, as we approach the proverbial shelf 

We should strive to be transparent 
To be explored by ourselves and others perhaps 
Guarding and mystery will change little 
Of what is plainly visible like symbols on maps
