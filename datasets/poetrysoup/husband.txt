Within Her Arms


Cradling him as he neared death,
As he drew his final breath,
Cradling the moment for life,
There she sat crying, his wife;

Within her arms she held him,
As his eyes were growing dim,
He beheld her one last time,
Shedding drops of love sublime;

Their eyes spoke of memories,
Those between-them-mysteries,
Then he smiled, he had no qualms,
For he died within her arms.
