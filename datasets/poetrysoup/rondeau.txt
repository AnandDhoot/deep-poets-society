Being Killed By A Drunk Driver

~Someone is killed by a drunk driver every fifty-three minutes~

My true nightmare, I’m stuck and caught,
to not drink and drive I was taught-
But the fear I hold is dying
by someone else who’s drunk driving-
Crushed in a smashed up car, I fought.

I tell myself it’s not their fault,
but truth be told this fear they brought.
If I forgive I’d be lying…
-my true nightmare

Through good council ease I have sought,
but apprehension will not halt-
panic in cars leaves me crying,
to cease this fear, I keep trying-
my totaled car leaves me distraught…
-my true nightmare
