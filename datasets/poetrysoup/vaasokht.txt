THESE FEET TRIED ALL YOUR SHOES


Young dainty feet used to tropical warmth,
went mostly bare or flip-flopped in and out
of strappy sandals for light airy feel,
in unchanging, hot clime, walking about

Came by your bigger feet in sailor’s suedes,
and off they swayed into the blue sunset.
Dreamy feet on adventure quest to roam,
donned diver’s shoes on barrier reef’s sharp wet.

Then hiking and climbing boots scaled the heights,
despite the tremor of toes in high fright,
till they froze with cold of the snow in skis,
all the while rejoicing in new, gained sights.

Yet when these feet wanted your dancing taps,
the truth spun like a slap-faced reel of real
lopsided share; not learning, but conquest.
Clicked aside the sad; they now kick in heels.
