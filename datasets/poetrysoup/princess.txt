DAUGHTER OF JOAN OF ARC

Daughter of Joan Of Arc
Daughter of Joan Of Arc
Eyebrows tinted and arched
Myriad dreams in contrast
To her mother.
A saint she was not.
Nor saintly 
A little dainty.
A sway in her walk.
Her perfumed lingered on rascals 
And thespians and lords.
Her hair swirled 
In scarlet. Her seaweed gaze
Stirred hurricane.
Daughter of Joan Of Arc
Born out of a wedlock.
Secreted in dens. 
Fed on wet nurses milk.
Daughter of Joan Of Arc
A soldier she was not.
A visionary she was 
Like her saint mother.
Her visions of silk and velvet
Gold and ruby and rouge 
And Kohl. 
Led her to brothel
Then to the throne
Daughter of Joan Of Arc
Made her mama proud.
Daughter of Joan Of Arc lives 
in twenty first century. Alas!
