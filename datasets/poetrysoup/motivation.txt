Pain behind Ourselves

Let me feel your pain,
And you can understand mine,
we all do feel drained,
hiding it in our own minds,
but we still go on.

why do we close ourselves in?
why are we so scared?
we always let the hate win,
while we have those who cared,
it eats us inside.

Talk to me an let it out,
bathe yourself in rain,
itâ€™s okay for you to shout,
the feeling is insane,
wash the sorrow off your face.

Let our pain be shared,
it makes us feel more human,
in life it's compared,
between the lost an the ruined,
but we still want to live.

It's hard to fight pain,
it is head aching,
it is mind breaking,
it is heart stabbing,
it is suffering,
but we still move on,
and keep pain behind,
behind our memories,
behind our names,
in the end with our own pain,
in this battle we stay in control.
