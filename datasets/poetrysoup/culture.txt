Let's...

Let's go back to our roots,
let's go back to heritage.

Don't forget your culture,
don't forget your parents,
always remember who you are.

Respect your self,
be proud of who you are.

You are a black African,
be proud of who you are,
you are beautiful in your black skin.

Even thou people says,
you are a blackberry,
a black mamba,
a black cherry.

You are ravishing in your skin colour,
don't let them win,
because the always talks.

I know the will judge you about your skin colour,
but don't comment.

You didn't choose,
to be black.

It is a will of our God,
so be proud of who you are.
