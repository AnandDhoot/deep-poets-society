Ella's Fairy Godmother Is Old Merryweather

You'll make a fantastic girl,
So slip on your converse slippers.
You'll have fun with a fairy
In the land of dreams galores.

Your charm is equal to a dress set on a whirl,
So transform while afloat in aquatic spheres.
Though you soon forgotten your friend of a fairy,
You were born anew, so your soul finally soars.
