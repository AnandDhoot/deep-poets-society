A Galaxy Of Bums

A galaxy of bums shining in delight.
Reflecting what your heart can't hold.
The feeling that they're twinkling far beyond your reach
confirming what your eyes been told.

While dancing as if gliding on in outer space
exhibiting the streaks of shooting stars.
The silence almost deafening to the common face
while screams seem muted to their scars.

Their melody of motion soothing to your soul.
Where asses seem to wander slow adrift.
One wonders what the the meaning takes to make you whole
and if it isn't blessed or gift.
