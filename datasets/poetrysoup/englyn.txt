Autumn

The bright green leaves are turning,
the forests look like burning;
cold weather is returning.

The days are growing shorter,
we're in the third year quarter;
the squirrel becomes a hoarder.

The stags in woods are clashing,
after the does they're dashing,
with raised white tales they're flashing.

The black bears are fat and round;
into deep dens they are bound,
spending winter underground.

Babbling brook takes its last run,
before freezing has begun;
must wait spring to have more fun.
