Missing the dead

Missing the dead

It's funny how your day can change 
From laughing and happy 
To road rage 
jumping out the car 
With an industrial file and beating someone's face 
Punk I told you give me space 
Your lucky I didn't have the burner 
Or you would have gotten a taste 
In the snap of a finger I'll wear that Orange jumpsuit again 
Or blue or red 
I'm classified as insane 
So I go to crazy pod 
My last celly beat his best friend to death while drunk and in rage 
Skitzopfrenia riddled his brain 
Back me in a corner 
And watch me peel your skin like a page 
A slave 
I'll beat you then piss on you 
I'm an apex predator and I will take from you 
The lesser few 
it's easy to 
Like taking candy from a baby 
You cry and say you miss your mommy 
Punk some of us never had one 
Around or a father 
Some of us haven't seen family in years 
So stop your tears 
I know I took your commissary 
But hey someone loves you 
They stock your books 
I was a cook 
Enforcer just like my father 
Sargent of arms 
For a 1%er 
Red and gold nation!!! 
Sylb syla! 
Bellingham Washington 
Rip pops 
You died young 
But your little soldier lives on 
Viking strong ! 
I love you dad 
I miss you so bad 
And everyones gone 
Cowboy rip 
Big George pops you wouldn't believe 
I'm alone and lonely 
And I've done things 
You can never take back.. 
I know your not mad jus sad 
I felt I had to do it 
A few times fuck I'm twisted 
Everyone says I'm just like you 
Loving and creative 
In both light and dark to 
But push the wrong button and 
Hey whatever happen to that man? 
Idk pops I'm thinking a lot 
I wish you were here just to point me to the track 
You always were good at that 
I gotta go pops but your brothers miss you 
Mom me and my sister 
We always miss you 
I'll see you in hell soon 
Valhalla whatever 
I'll be there with you
