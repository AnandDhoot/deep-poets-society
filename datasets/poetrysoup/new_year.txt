New Year's night

New Year’s night


There is a fire burning and people are drinking;
People are dancing and people are singing.
Auld lang syne, it’s another year gone,
So cherish this night, because it will soon be done.


The snow is falling all around us and many friends are merry;
So give everyone a hug and kiss those cheeks.
Come on now, feast upon the many cherries and berries;
Swig from the tankard and have yourselves some meat,
Because this is a celebration, so enjoy the feast.


Hold the one you love and greet your neighbour’s as family,
Because soon enough, you will be back at each other’s throats.
So give them your blessings and wish upon a star;
Offer everyone a piece of peace 
And see this New Year as a chance to end the feud 
And as a chance for new relationships to grow.
