the cake shop

The Cake Shop 
There was a small cake shop near the bath-house
If I had money went in there for a coffee and a cake
the girl behind the counter smiled I fell under her spell
and my heart beating too fast made me dizzy
Her name was Berta and the loveliest thing on earth
I must invite her out for a walk in the park.
She closed her shop at five I borrowed brother`s tie and
used his after shave. Alas outside the shop stood a man tall 
and handsome I walked by and into a deep shadow.
When she came out, they kissed and walked hand in hand 
down the road, she said something and he laughed. 
Devastated I sank to the ground and bitterly cried how stupid 
I had been the burning shame, couldn`t go into her shop again 
had she told him about me when she laughed?
Found another place where an old lady of thirty served I felt at ease
with her, she laughed and often kissed me.
But life is not sweet chocolate I had to work and with no education
 I joined the merchant navy a place for poor boys who didn`t want 
to work in factories, and left dreams behind. Or did I?
