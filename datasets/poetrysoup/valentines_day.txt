My Love

There is a universe of stars in her eyes reflecting the culmination 
of my everlasting and undying  love for her Her beauty matches that of the reflection of light on top of the surface of the ocean shimmering and sparkling in the midst of a golden sunrise. She is vibrant as the blooming flowers in the springtime in contrast to my cold winter resolve which becomes grey as the moon in times of deep distress. To her my darkness and lack of enthusiasm is a mysterious disappointment. Although I have never expected understanding for he who does not understand himself can simply not be understood. She moves with natural grace and the tides eb and flow. we are yin and yang the harmonious balance of all that exists between us.
