Your hearts burn holes through my barriers
letting love seep through like a soothing aloe
I find peace through the ties that bind we three together
like a comforting bandage, mending my wounds

My Sunshine and my Moonlight, my light and my dark;
you are the pieces I needed to complete this puzzle of love
You ignite the flames of my passion
and cool the fever in my soul

Through every battle we trudge through together,
bathed in blood we shed and tears we spend,
I will always see to it our banners will always stand together,
that no one is left behind for the carrion to feeds to feast upon

Our love will endure the scorching heat of Fire,
will never be torn apart by the strength of Wind,
will never be drowned by the endless oceans of Water,
and will survive the unmerciful changes of the Earth

Our love will outlast time itself

So it is done
