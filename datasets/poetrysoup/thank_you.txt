Pray With Me

I have been young and I have seen a lot.
My struggles have been deep, but the troubles have not overshadowed your blessings: 
the gift of life, the gift of love, the gift of speed and the gift of height.
Thank you for the early mornings and the chilling cold.
Thank you for the air and the cool breeze.
Thank you for this soft cushion and dependable chair.
Thank you for the water that refreshes me.
Thank you for my bed that is faithfully there.
Thank you for happiness and the occasional sadness.
Thank you for the sun: I sometimes wish you turn it a little down.
Thank you for your rebukes that has made me better.
Thank you for art, comedy and humor.
Thank you for children with such free spirits and enthralling smiles.
Thank you for the rulers without your fear: they are still in your hands.
Thank you for me and imperfection - we have so much in common.
Thank you for such wonderful sermons my father give.
Thank you for the corollary that makes principles into miracles.
Thank you for my travels: I marvel at your creations.
Thank you for the poor amongst us and the rich that are no better.
Thank you because I do more than myself: yes thank you for faith.
Thank you for your life in me and the peace you give.
Thank you for the strength to face today.
Lastly, thank you for sanity Lord and for your loud silence: 
that is only when I hear you, yes, in your silence. Thank you Lord.
