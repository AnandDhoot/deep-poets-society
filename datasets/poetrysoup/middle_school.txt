What It Is

People ask
What is middle school?
I know exactly, precisely
What it is.
Middle school is a game.
It’s a game of tag
When someone’s tired of
Being the “it” person
They tag someone else
That’s what it is
It’s a game of peek-a-boo
Hoping to peek at that someone
The same time they peek at you
That’s what it is
It’s a game of cops and robbers
We’re the robbers; teachers, cops
We try to not get caught
That’s what it is
It’s a game of kickball
If you don’t kick hard enough,
You’re out.
That’s what it is
It’s a game of hide and seek
Trying to find the best spot
And stay there as long as you can
That’s what it is
It’s a game of bingo
Waiting for the right thing
And then it’s your lucky day
That’s what it is
It’s a game of soccer
You run past the defense
And kick into the goal
I know exactly what middle school is.
It’s a game, and that’s
What it is.
