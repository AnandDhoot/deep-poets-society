Sandbox

She carried it with her, wherever she went.
It never left her sight. She grew with it,
from the time she lived with her parents
as a child, in their beloved tropical island.
Her father gave it to her, as a Christmas gift
for her eighth birthday. He wanted her to carry
some memories of him and her mother wherever
she went. 
At first, it was light. She didn't want to carry
any sand with her. Sand couldn't carry memories;
only texture of fineness.
Now, the sandbox has some weight of memories;
she has photos of her parents, grandparents,
their house, the ocean, sandcastles.....
Her sandbox slowly wears out,
but time is unable to fade the memories...
