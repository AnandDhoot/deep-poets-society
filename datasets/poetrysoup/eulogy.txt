Thank You

Thank you??

My heart is warmed
With all the caring
The generic letters and
All the staring

My heart is heavy
With sadness and despair
My lungs are clawing as they grasp for air
I wish for love, but does any one care?

I may be young
I may be an old haunted soul
I have a friend
As lonely as I, death our only goal

Hanging in the distance
Or hanging by a rope
We made a pact
The tiniest of suicidal hopes

I shouted in silence
Is anyone there?
Please, listen, listen to my total disrepair
My ears like an owls, yet no voices to share

Faint hopes
Doubtless dreams
Suicidal screams
My only choice to tie neck to rope

I tossed a poem out to the sea
Like a lifejacket, I just wanted to see
No one saw, and no one cared
Generic letters drowning, in the sea of despair

Poetry was my last breath of fresh air
