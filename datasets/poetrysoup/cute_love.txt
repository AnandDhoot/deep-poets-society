Likewise I said

Dancing along the music
You holding me in your hands
Whispering into my ears... How beautiful I am and ask,
Where have I been all your life!

Likewise I said...

Moving to the rhythm of the music
I relax my body into your arms holding me ever so gently.
Smiling into the night and wondering-
Why have I not met you sooner
I feel wonderful in your arms
You feel right in my arms.
Tonight is perfect... We are making a life time memory!

Am I dreaming you into life?
Because if so don't wake me- I'm in love with this dream and its handsome character.

Gently holding me closer
and whisper,
Baby the night is young
The music is ours 
Keep dancing with me, 
I'm all yours.

Likewise I said...

Stealing a glimpse of your handsome face
My heart skipped a beat. 

You caught me gaping 
Neither said a word-
Lips touching
Tongues locked
The night was spinning away!

What wonderful feeling exist like that
Is it real
Am I dreaming you into life
Oh, but you are in my arms
You feel right in my arms 
I feel wonderful in your arms 
Loving you tenderly...

Unconsciously I hold you closer and whisper, baby I'll never let you go!

Likewise you said... 

Collapsed on stars and floated away into the Galaxy, with hearts contently fill with joy.
