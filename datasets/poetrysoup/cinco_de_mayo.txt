Sonnet for a dead poet

When he wrote
his first poem
the sky opened up
like a sign from heaven
and uncle Ben
who plays for the local band
in an all you can eat joint
got drunk
and slept on a bench.

Yes
the village now has a poet.

He wrote
and wrote
and wrote again
until he wrote
a million poems...

With borrowed money
published the book
and sold only three
one to aunt Katrine
who is deaf and blind
and called the book "a masterpiece"
one to the Pakistani guy
who pumps gas
down the street
and after only ten seconds
asked for the money back
otherwise was gonna wreck his 62 Buick.
"Burn the motherfucker down
screamed the poet,
because i'm sick
of this piece of shit."

The third book
went to a drug dealer
who instead of money
rolled him some weed,
little crystal meth
some crack cocaine,
all this
to tell him that there is no more
poetry
since Biggie
and Tupac got killed...

It's just ghetto
and bull malarkey
canned for export.

If you want to be famous
and rich
write a poem
the last one
with a catchy title
that nobody want to read 
even with an AK-47 on his head,
unless is totally stoned.

This way
we grow up business
selling what people want best
you know what i mean
weed and cocaine
and become big
bigger than Kanye West
and his own Yeez
with a castle next to Usher
the singer
and another 
next to C-Lo Green.

And one day
rich and famous
with a tweet account
over a billion tweeters
and a Facebook page
bigger the Atlantic ocean
and the Pacific
stoned
fall
and drop dead
somebody will write
"Yeah,maybe dead,but a hell of a poet."

Or was he?...
