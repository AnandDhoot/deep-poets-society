Moves To Zero

                        Moves To Zero
                (Randometer Functionality)

Randometers measure sequential ordered elements
Coded, incomplete, repeating
Drawn to the core of reason compartmentalized
Run from pens with solid ink
Rounded shapes sink into paper
Compositionality on curved particulars considered

Don't let facts get in the way
Dots parade, line up in space
Run from pens with solid ink
Rounded shapes sink into paper
Redundant, coded, incomplete, repeating

Levers move, calculate the soul, holes within
Turn separable logic switches on with warmth
Circular conclusions measurements
Form comfort zones in gravity
Create fractions down to zero

Dream gears find permanence on new platforms
Equate levels 1 through 5 slide rule wise
Perform with accuracy
Complete their circuits
Move to measure electronic hours
Dictate which direction time moves on

Constituent components rise in the dark
Concepts must be formulaic
Come without warning in the morning
Zero intent in mind
