From His Mighty Throne

From His Mighty Throne He is watching us.
What does He see?
When He gets out His Omnipotent spectacles does He find you walking in peace?
Are you loving your neighbor and speaking kindness over everyone?
Even those who you don't agree with?
Jesus Christ is the epitome of humbleness.
Is that what your life professes?

From His Mighty Throne He is watching us.
He is scanning with His eyes of fire.
He never misses a thing nor will He ever.
He is constantly scanning the intentions of your heart.
What does He see as He scans your heart?
Have you sent all of your burdens to the foot of His Cross?

From His Mighty Throne He is watching me.
Did I put on my cloak of humility?
Did I take along an extra measure of humbleness when all of the other Christians come out to persecute me?
Did I store enough treasures upon this planet too, or did I send everything straight up to you, Oh, Heavenly Father?
I give all of my burdens and all of my eternal treasures back to you. 
The world has turned from generosity and has withheld its smile once again.
I grab your hand ever so tightly for you are truly my only Friend.
