Watching You Sleep

Watching you sleep,
So calm and relaxed,
Hair becoming a big mess,
One hand layed under your head,
The other one layed on the bed,
Legs curled up,
Just slightly bent,
Dreaming away,
As the day is done and spent,
A silent bliss,
In your dreams so sweet,
Having the angels watch over you,
Head upon the pillow,
Covers pulled to your neck,
Good cuddeling time,
As good times well spent....
