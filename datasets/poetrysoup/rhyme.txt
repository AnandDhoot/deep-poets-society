An autumn masterpiece

.

As fall now spins its color wheel,
a’ changing of the leaves to share
Simple are these pleasures shown
now won’t you come and meet me there

To feel the breeze upon your skin
in wafting scents of mountain pine
So I may hold you close to me,
and know you’ll be forever mine

Perhaps we’ll share a tender kiss
while walking slowly in the sun 
Admiring the season’s view
as nothing more could be such fun

Then spend the day in shaded bliss
beneath a pastel maple tree
Here in the park as autumn paints
a masterpiece for you and me
