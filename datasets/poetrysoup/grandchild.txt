A Lullabye For Ava

Close your eyes my darlin' girl,
day is done, time for dreams to unfurl.
   
Dream of pretty ponies p r a n c i n g by,
of fairies and princesses as well,
maybe even visit Tinkerbelle.
Dream of having wings to f  l  y
then soar through rainbow tinted sky,
                               up where angels dwell.
                    higher
         higher,
rising 

Angels will keep watch
as you dream your sweetest dreams
cocooned in loves warm mantle.
Sleep, my darlin', sleep
until morning rises fair.
Follow your dreams where they lead.
