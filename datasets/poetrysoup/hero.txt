Bobby, Billy, Belinda, Baby and Me

Bobby Brown threatened to knock me down
  but Billy Blues took off his shoes and with a barefoot blocked his fist
  just as it brandished my wrist,
  and even though they fought desparately in the rain,
  neither bothered to complain.
They boxed and kicked and blew smoke
  but neither even spoke.
Finally I cried, "Stop!"
  "Belinda is calling a cop!"
So bloody and bruised, Billy put on his shoes.
Bobby was so muddy he looked really cruddy.
And though I felt bad because Billy was bloody, 
  I was bound to boast to my friends
  how Billy had come to my defense.
And now Billy and me and baby makes three
  and Bobby is history!
