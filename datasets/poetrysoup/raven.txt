THE RAVEN

He rode into her slumbering village,
Feeling something quite not said.
A chilling breeze passing eerily through him.
Silent voices of the dead.

Her Pine and leather fragrance;
Hanging listless in the air.
He could feel her cold strong fingers,
Gently passing through his hair.

He then felt her spirit rising...
To ride the westward winds.
She had left him all alone now,
To the mercy of past sins.

He then walked into her Hogan;
Knowing well what he'd find there...
She was wrapped in doeskin Leather, 
A yellow rose tucked in her hair.
He found the note beside her.
Said: "My love, you need not feel the blame...
Sometimes death is just as simple...
As a Raven...calling out my name."
