My Armor is Wearing Thin

As the Lord holds me up, I look up and praise His Name
I think of His Cup in so suffering and dying for my shame
And as my Armor now wears thin as the enemies attack
When in God's Name one so bares in knowing how I lack

Each shot more disarming with weapons from far and wide
But with that, who are they harming in the ways they tried
And the bigger perspective in the total decay of all mankind
Always expected to just live amongst all the trash we mined

But there is always a Way when it is Christ that you put first
In such days I pray.  Oh Lord Jesus how You quench my thirst
The Armor He will replace as You've grown out of the old one
Knowing Him you just see His Grace sending us His Only Son

I could gossip and complain and get so caught up in that mess
But really I just need to stay sane and allow the Lord to Bless
As He so often lets me realize blessing us all beyond any belief
I really have to open my eyes and stop complaining about such grief
