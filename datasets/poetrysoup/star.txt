Evening Orange

Oranges are always lovely
Nestling unknowable dreams
But they never come to you obligingly 
You need to have a heart genuine 

The evening clouds in the sky
Have raised colours of hushed height 
I perceive some salted stimuli
Of possible oranges in sight

But what actually comes
Is a splash of orange light
Asking me how are my lungs
The cranes in their homeward flight 

Are then the orange seasons gone
Those tickling smells of paradise
A flock of fireflies in the lawn
One by one the stars arise
