Stagnant World

Ever so peaceful you appear,
Disguising your eternal suffrage.
Silent is your noted fear;
For to humans, you take umbrage.

Yet you try to smile, 
As the crimson stains your body.
You chant “Peace!” in denial,
To your own folly.

Bear witness to carnage;
Bear witness to despair.
For you are the stage,
In which they all appear!

Stagnant are we in turning peace to war,
Leaving your sorrowful mind with a silent scar.
