 
  (Spring begins in southern England on the 14th April, on which date the Old Woman lets the Cuckoo out of her basket at Heathfield Fair -- locally known as Heffle Cuckoo Fair.)
 
 
 
 
 Tell it to the locked-up trees,
 
 Cuckoo, bring your song here!
 
 Warrant, Act and Summons, please,
 
 For Spring to pass along here!
 
 Tell old Winder, if he doubt,
 
 Tell him squat and square -- a!
 
 Old Woman!
 
 Old Woman!
 
 Old Woman's let the Cuckoo out
 
 At Heffle Cuckoo Fair -- a!
 
 
 March has searched and April tried --
 
 'Tisn't long to Mary now.
 
 Not so far to Whitsuntide
 
 And Cuckoo's come to stay now!
 
 Hear the valiant fellow shout
 
 Down the orchard bare -- a!
 
 Old Woman!
 
 Old Woman!
 
 Old Woman's let the Cuckoo out
 
 At Heffle Cuckoo Fair -- a!
 
 
 When your heart is young and gay
 
 And the season rules it --
 
 Work your works and play your play
 
 'Fore the Autumn cools it!
 
 Kiss you turn and turn-about,
 
 But my lad, beware -- a!
 
 Old Woman!
 
 Old Woman!
 
 Old Woman's let the Cuckoo out
 
 At Heffle Cuckoo Fair -- a!
