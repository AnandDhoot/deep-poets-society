 I am the Most Wise Baviaan, saying in Most wise tones,
 
 "Let us melt into the landscape -- just us two by our lones."
 
 People have come -- in a carriage -- calling. But Mummy is
 
 there. . . .
 
 Yes, I can go if you take me--Nurse says she don't care.
 
 Let's go up to the pig-styes and sit on the farmyard rails!
 
 Let's say things to the bunnies, and watch 'em skitter their tails!
 
 Let's'-oh, anything, daddy, so long as it's you and me,
 
 And going truly exploring, and not being in till tea!
 
 Here's your boots (I've brought 'em), and here's your cap and stick,
 
 And here's your pipe and tobacco. Oh, come along out of it -- quick!
