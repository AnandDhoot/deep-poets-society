Ambitious views never fired my lowly breast,
Contented competence to me a throne;
In some sequestered vale my head to rest
And on some kindred heart repose my own.
To share such toil as gives to ease its zest,
Such temperate mirth as wisdom's self might own;
A cot within with smiles and neatness dressed,
Without with fragrant woodbine overgrown.
Secure to please, the sweetest task confessed
The aim to please entirely, one alone;
With love and peace and union to be blessed,
By fashion's slaves unnoticed and unknown.
To have a little for the more distressed
And with kind deeds the want of wealth atone.
