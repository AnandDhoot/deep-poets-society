A book of sonnets! Here are letters taken
From life's illuminated alphabet;
Some in a grey ground, some in scarlet set;
Some in a dust of starry spangles shaken
From midnight skies. Others there be that waken
To a strange life of their own (and so forget
The hand's cunning that made them) stranger yet
Than any lived since Eden was forsaken.
Here is a crystal, here a star, a flower,
And here a voice like a great organ-tone,
That shapes itself, that shines, unveils a face
Fair as a face in dreams, that in its hour
Makes wondrous music; each living its own
Life, perfect, with inimitable grace.

But thou hast read how Cleopatra went
To Antony, her lustrous eyes a-shine,
Through mazy webs of love fit to entwine
A simple conqueror palaced in a tent;
And how her pearl, a monnrch's ransom, blent
Its iridescence with the sharp white wine
To pleasure her, as with an air divine
She quaffed it to the Roman's dazzlement.
In such wise make, and take, a sonnet. Throw
Into the wine emotion, the pure pearl
Of artistry, and while 'tis yet a-swirl
And beading bravely, snare with subtile craft
A gleam of golden light upon it--so!
Then, breathless, drain it at a single draught!

Here fix the tablet. This must be the place
Where our Columbus of the South did land.
He saw the Indian village on that sand
And on this rock first met the simple race
Of Austral Indians who presumed to face
With lance and spear his musket. Close at hand
Is the clear stream from which his vent'rous band
Refreshed their ship; and thence a little space
Lies Sutherland, their shipmate; for the sound
Of Christian burial better did proclaim
Possession than the flag, in England's name.
These were the commelinae Banks first found;
But where's the tree, with the ship's wood-carved fame?
Fix, then, the Ephesian brass--'tis classic ground!
