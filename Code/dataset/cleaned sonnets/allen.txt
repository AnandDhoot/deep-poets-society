If they were shadows walking to and fro 
Upon a screen you call reality, 
Then, when the light fails, where do shadows go? 
This boy enigma rapes philosophy. 
But if they really occupied three-square, 
And now are only shadows on a screen, 
How can the light still cast a shadow there 
From shades of shadows that have never been? 
Such questions are a mimic pantomime 
Of ghosts to utter nothings in dream chairs, 
Myopia squinting in a mist of time, 
An eye that sees the eye with which it stares. 
Your light too clearly shows the ancient stigma 
Of questions solved by posing an enigma.
