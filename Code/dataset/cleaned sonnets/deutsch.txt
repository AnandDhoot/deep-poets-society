Heat urges secret odors from the grass. 
Blunting the edge of silence, crickets shrill. 
Wings veer: inane needles of light, and pass. 
Laced pools: the warm wood-shadows ebb and fill. 
The wind is casual, loitering to crush 
The sun upon his palate, and to draw 
Pungence from pine, frank fragrances from brush, 
Sucked up through thin grey boughs as through a straw. 
Moss-green, fern-green and leaf and meadow-green 
Are broken by the bare, bone-colored roads, 
Less moved by stirring air than by unseen 
Soft-footed ants and meditative toads. 
Summer is passing, taking what she brings: 
Green scents and sounds, and quick ephemeral wings.
